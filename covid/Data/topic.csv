0,"SCs are typically presented as smartphone chatbot apps and are created for one of two aims.
All SCs surveyed were presented in chatbot format to provide a natural mechanism for data collection from the user, mimicking their experience of speaking to a clinician.
Chatbot simulation videos were created using a design and prototyping tool (Botsociety Inc).
To avoid visual elements from confounding the experiment, the chatbot design was limited to text interaction.
The chatbot video ends by informing the user that the disease requires immediate clinical attention and showing the user booking an appointment with a general practitioner.
All experimental treatments, even no explanation, involved viewing a 3-minute chatbot interaction.
Chatbots are used to share information, reassure people, help to assess COVID-19 risk, help patients to get treatment and keep them away from emergency care centers [42]."
1,"We show that the minimum sensor placement problem can be formulated as a set cover problem.
For each candidate sensor node, let Ri denote the set of target nodes that have a direct path to the state node xi∈X.
3 A–E concern sensors and targets randomly placed in the inference graph.
The sensor placement, in particular, was implemented by first finding the minimum set of sensor nodes for functional observability and then, increasing q with randomly placed sensor nodes.
3C that this optimal sensor placement can be relevant for systems of any dimension.
6A highlights the selected set of four sensor cities for functional observability as provided by Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 provides an approximate solution to the minimum sensor placement problem in polynomial time.
Second, a greedy algorithm is used (while loop) to find an approximation of the minimum set of sensor nodes such that structurally functional observability is guaranteed.
The nine sensor nodes were attached to three separate masts (three nodes per mast) at equally spaced heights from 25 to 210 cm (LO, MID, and HI) above floor level."
2,"This assumption has a long history in population genetics (52) and evolutionary biology (53), and it has also been used to formulate predictions for behavioral experiments with human subjects (54).
But in those studies the fitness advantage of the mutant is fixed, independent of type frequency.
It might, therefore, be used to estimate the genetic evolution in real cases.
Deviations from these predictions in genetic data could reveal the strength of selection or network effects.
Taken together, various factors can have an impact on the final phenotype, i.e.
The fitness of the generation will be measured; “parents” will be randomly selected based on a fitness function."
3,"Movies were recorded with a Camera (Sony® FDR AX-33) and analyzed using Da Vinci Resolve video editing software (Magic Mirror).
All the sequences in these datasets are captured from a canonical viewpoint and recorded in controlled environments.
The sequences are captured at a higher quality and with a better contrast between the subject and the background.
The captured sequences are processed to produce four different representations:sequence of binary silhouettes;sequence of skeletal images;GEIs;SEIs.
The sequences were captured using two synchronized cameras, capturing both the sagittal and frontal views.
In this context sequences with a deviating shape have been used to detect skulls from a primate species that differs from the rest of the collection [114]."

5,"Since the data in the third interval is reliable, we do not make any imputations for u¯′′′ and y¯3′′′.
Imputation of the missing values is required (we present our method in Section 3.1).
At first, we propose an estimation procedure for the imputation model from Section 3.1.
Given a partially imputed data set, we specify how to get estimates for the infection model from Section 3.2.
Finally, the multiple imputation scheme combining both approaches is presented.
Imputation model: We get estimates for the imputation model through maximising the likelihood function resulting from Equation (3).
Given a partially imputed data set, we first consider θ to be a nuisance parameter and find c via a profile likelihood approach.
Since this is a tree-based model, it has the advantage of being able to process data with missing values [21]."
6,"To date, the velocity of expired air according to the type of vocal exercise performed during speech therapy is unknown.
The objective of this study was to determine the velocity of the expired air during vocal exercises, and to compare these data with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study.
Expired air velocities varied according to the vocal exercises and are reported in Table 1.
Our results showed great variability in the expired air velocities, ranging from 0.28 to 1.8 m/s depending on the vocal exercise performed.
In all vocal exercises, the initial velocity remained inferior to 1 m/s for vowels and voiced consonants, even in loud voicing.
Our study revealed that velocities of the expired air produced during vocal exercises are slower than in long exhalation, suggesting no increased risk compared to standard speech."
7,"The materials consisted of pure tones and elicitation of sustained versions of the primary cardinal vowels, [i, e, ɛ, a, ɑ, ɔ, o, u].
Here, we report only on the results from the vowel recordings.
Audio files containing artificial vowels with a duration of over 1 s were created using Praat's VowelEditor.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that lossless recordings from phones can be a viable method for recording vowel data for acoustic analysis, at least with respect to F0–F2.
The participants were audio-recorded or recorded themselves while producing the sustained vowels /a:/, /e:/, /i:/, /o:/, /u:/ (order like this), representing phonemes of German standard language.
Then, we use audacity (Audacity, 2021) to segment the recordings for all single vowels to be exported as separate audio files for the feature extraction step."
8,"Table 2 presents the number of truncated 15-s recordings and the total duration.
Missing samples were set to zero.” However, there were no audible glitches, and files could be opened.
A small number of zero sequences were found in the recordings, confirming that the AVR was dropping samples.
The analysis showed that the vast majority of zero sequences found within the recordings consisted of only 2 samples, whereas none exceeded 20 samples.
Sequences of more than 20 zero samples were found only at the very beginning of the recordings and had a maximum of 150 zeros (=4.7 ms).
These were compared to artificially corrupted versions of the same files such that the latter included sequences of up to 20 zero samples."
9,"We accommodate all Unicode characters, including emojis, contending with punctuation as fully as possible (see Appendix A for further details).
We focus our analysis on the usage of emojis in these contexts.
We are particularly interested in answering the following research questions: (1) how widely do developers use emojis?
This implies that emojis are indeed used for multiple purposes on GitHub.
Beyond the general popularity of emoji usage, we are interested in whether the patterns vary across different characteristics or communities of developers.
PowerShell stands as an outlier, likely because it attracts a small group of developers who prefer a small set of emojis.
Finally, we note that the control variables, platform age, and most programming languages are significant factors in the regressions of emoji usage.
Among all emoji usage patterns, the most basic one is whether a user uses emoji at all.
For this prediction task, we include only the emoji users since the emoji-usage features for non-emoji users are either empty or zero."
10,"Web programming languages, such as JavaScript, HTML, TypeScript, and CSS, are among the languages with the highest proportion of emoji posts.
We find that developers who have longer working hours tend to write more emoji posts—but only for those in the most active quantile (4).
The regression results are promising, suggesting that emoji usage is highly reflecting working status of individual developers rather than community norms.
To control for this confounding factor, we match emoji users with a set of non-emoji users who have a similar distribution of programming languages within the same activity level.
Therefore we intentionally exclude non-emoji-based features (such as the working status measures in the previous section) and more complex machine learning models so that the whole process is highly explainable.
We summarize the emoji-usage features used in the prediction task.
Another possible explanation is that as non-verbal cues, emojis can bring in external effects (that plain texts could not) that in turn influence the working status of developers (emoji users)."
11,"2010) created an application that identified, extracted, and generated maps of route directions found on webpages providing textual (often formatted) directions to reach a location.
While the GeoCAM project complements our current research, their problem is simpler since route directions are just a small subset of movement descriptions.
Furthermore, route directions typically follow a semi-structured pattern that allows for simpler ML models and rules-based approaches.
In a precursor to the GeoCAM project, Drymonas and Pfoser (2010) used similar techniques to map route directions.
These projects encouraged future work like ours to go beyond route directions to general movement descriptions (Klippel et al.
This technique has also shown success in commercial production mapping systems like Google Maps, where users reach their destination, and Maps asks about driving directions’ accuracy.
Finally, the TSP with GA can provide unbiased route suggestion based on cost, emergency, distance, and other factors."
12,"Additionally, we have several fresh fruits and vegetables, such as cabbage, potatoes, pears, fennel, and mandarins.
We also have prepared vegetables as well as frozen vegetables.
Besides fruits and vegetables, we have beverages such as mineral water and tea, and several other ingredients such as tomato paste, rice, red meat, pastry, and jam.
Additionally, we notice several ingredients used to prepare a vegetable soup or a broth, which are nutritious and hydrating as well as soothing when served hot.
We notice that the majority of the products make intuitive sense, as we have several fruits and vegetables, as well as ingredients for soup, tissues, water, and tea.
Here again, thinking about the problem before blindly applying standard recipes is of paramount importance to get it right."
13,"The evolution of PMN and PMA Applications seem to follow inverse trajectories, while that of Total MD Applications resembles the sum of the two qualitatively (Fig.
A detailed description of the equilibration protocol used for MD simulations can be found in the ESI.‡
MD simulations were performed using two MD engines, NAMD and OpenMM, on three machines, Frontera, Summit and SuperMUC-NG.
Despite continuous advances
in hardware and software, carrying
out MD simulations remains computationally challenging.
The critical element in many of these open-source software is the ability to implement network theory-based calculations to analyze MD simulation trajectories.
Here we provide an example of the application of network theory to analyze MD simulation trajectories.
We have reviewed the methodology for such integration of MD simulation with network theory-based analyses."
14,"To test the validity of our results, we performed a series of ablation studies which independently reduce either the architecture of our neural network or the considered epidemiological model.
For each of these ablation studies, we used the same number of simulations and training settings as before.
The results from all ablation studies are available in S1 Text.
Interestingly, no ablation scenario leads to dramatic miscalibration across all marginal posteriors.
We addressed these issues by suitable model extensions, which are motivated by theoretical considerations and ablation studies.
The ablation study found that the novel loss term is the key innovation of the model."
15,"However, in our analysis, we aimed to understand the medical concepts related to BII from social media texts.
In IG-BII, people also discussed their recovery process from the issues or events associated with BII.
This indicates that these were common issues that were significantly associated with BII.
Unfortunately, such domain knowledge on complications, symptoms, and other issues associated with or caused by BII were not fully available.
Future methodological research on NLP could include causality inference between BII and symptom and sign mentions from social media to understand their relations, etc.
Our findings could provide the relevant domains for clinical research studies seeking to develop measures of BII and to identify its causes.
More specifically, our results can provide a patient-derived definition of BII, which can be useful to clinicians treating patients with BII concerns to use this patient-centered language.
Our analysis of social media data identified mentions such as rupture, infection, inflammation, pain, and fatigue, which were common self-reported issues on social media sites dedicated to BII."
16,"Under each of these five pathways, we calculated GCP, the metric most consistent with the cost-effectiveness principle.
The additional costs discussed above may appear rather modest, and the choice of pathways has a much larger impact on the absolute costs than the choice of metrics (figs.
Previous studies (25, 26, 28) reported remarkable regional and sectoral impacts from the choice of metrics, despite relatively small global impacts.
From a practical perspective, it is useful to interpret our theoretical cost-effective outcome through the eyes of well-established metrics from the IPCC AR5.
We further find that the flexible approach using best available metrics will cost less than any fixed approach, including one using the metric with the optimal time horizon.
Our results point to a fundamental limit associated with the fixed use of metrics and further support the flexible use of metrics under a range of mitigation pathways.
More specifically, we utilize information-theoretic methods to give a lower bound on the expected cost and describe simple strategies that can significantly reduce the expected cost over currently known strategies."
17,"On the other hand, many stressed stocks did not show signs of speedy recovery [26], [28].
Generally, if the sentiment of the investors remain negative, recovery becomes slow.
Ψst is used to analyze the effects of different shock lengths, anti-fragility, negative sentiment lengths and fund-flow during recovery on the stock price movement.
In the present study, the values of λ during normal, shock, negative sentiment, recovery and post recovery period are λ=0.3,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.3, respectively.
These analyses show that the recovery rate directly depends on the ϕ when the sentiment is positive.
The figure shows that when there is no negative sentiment, price starts recovering after the shock period is over.
The figure shows that the stocks with shortest shock length, i.e., TS=15D recovers quickly to its initial level after the sentiment turns positive."
18,"These quality stocks recovered very quickly from the crash, i.e., showing V-shaped recovery.
Though this model explains the V- and L-shaped recoveries of stocks, it fails to explain the U- and Swoosh-shaped recoveries that depends mainly on the sentiment.
The recovery depends only on the fund-flow by the investors.
The stock with the least TS will have maximum recovery period.
We have obtained U-shaped and Swoosh-shaped recovery of stock price from the model simulation using the real normalized net fund-flow data (Ψt).
The Nifty Realty, Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial show U-shaped recovery from our simulation result and Nifty IT shows a Swoosh-shaped recovery."
19,"Thus, we also examine a possible relationship between volatility asymmetry and efficiency-related measures.
When the efficiency-related measures indicate that the market is more efficient, the volatility asymmetry weakens.
We describe the results on the market efficiency in more detail later.
The magnitude of the volatility asymmetry may relate with the market state, especially the market efficiency.
We find that when these efficiency-related measures indicate that the market is more efficient, the volatility asymmetry is more likely to weaken.
It might be interesting to investigate whether these models lead to the similar results on the volatility asymmetry.
The efficiency of an estimator is defined as the variance of a benchmark estimator divided by the variance of that particular estimator:(35)Efficiency (Estimator)=Var(Benchmark)Var(Estimator)
Let i be an Italian municipality in our sample; we define the relative variation in efficiency Δei as (ei,t1−ei,t0)/ei,t0, where ei is defined in Eq."
20,"This asymmetric pattern of volatility also exists in higher frequency returns.
However, some studies report that there is no significant asymmetry in volatility [17, 29].
An opposite result to the inverted asymmetry, that is, the same volatility reaction as stocks, is documented [30].
We infer that the discrepancy observed in the volatility asymmetry is caused, in part, by the time-varying property of volatility asymmetry.
It is empirically well-known that stock return volatility increases after negative returns more than positive returns [26, 27].
This volatility asymmetry is called “the leverage effect” and causes a negative correlation between stock returns and volatility.
For the TGARCH model, the volatility asymmetry is measured by the γ parameter in Eq (3), and when the leverage effect exists, the γ parameter takes a positive value.
This price dispersion over time is identified as the historical volatility of a financial security over a period of time."
21,"They compared the unsteady RANS (URANS) approach with the analytical Wells–Riley model.
Underestimation of the mean concentration predicted by the Wells–Riley theory in this case is clearly seen in Fig.
Besides the well-mixed assumption, there are several other assumptions associated with Wells-Riley formulations, which are not necessarily always true.
In this manuscript, we will consider the following generalizations and modifications to the Wells-Riley formulation:
The biggest limitation to the model presented here, like all Wells-Riley formulations, is the well-mixed environment assumption.
Any corrections developed for mono-multiplicity Wells-Riley formulations could either be used as is or could be adapted to the poly-multiplicity model presented in this manuscript."
22,"Second, using the Baidu Index, we created a fear sentiment index toward the COVID-19 pandemic to determine whether the panic related to it correlated with stock market crashes.
Finally, we investigated the role of fear sentiment with regard to the impact of COVID-19 on stock market crash risk.
However, few studies have examined the effect of investor sentiment, especially fear sentiment, on systematic risk in emerging economies during the onset of COVID-19.
Next, we employed the Granger causality test to detect any causal relationship between stock market crash risk and fear sentiment.
The null hypothesis for Granger causality is summarized as “fearSent does not cause the Granger causality to Skew” (fearSent→Skew).
In this case, the fear sentiment may have influenced the stock market before the impact from confirmed cases.
Therefore, we performed a Granger causality test to determine whether the fear emotion could increase market crash risk.
Note from Table 6 that fearSent is the Granger cause of Skew, which implies that fear sentiment causes stock market crash risk."
23,"The NV centers will feel
weaker magnetic noise and have a longer T1 time, indicated by a
larger fluorescence intensity at fixed wait time.
NV centers near the ND surface
would also significantly suffer from random surface charge noise, potentially leading to
deleterious charge dynamics of the NV centers.
This can be mitigated by better engineering
the NV-containing NDs (for example, with surface coating28,29) to produce NV centers that are well-below the
ND surface and close to the NDs’ origin.
We built a theoretical model to describe the quenching of
NV’s relaxation time due to dipolar interactions between NV center and
Gd3+ molecules and to evaluate the sensor’s performance.
4 at d0,max=  50-μm cutoff are very plausible upper limits.
This suggests that dM should be chosen somewhere in the 10–100 μm range, which is further supported by the Wells curves found by Xie et al."
24,"Thus, we argue that properties of the Bitcoin market are mostly time dependent.
To fully understand the dynamics of Bitcoin time series, we need to investigate various aspects of Bitcoin.
Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin has inherently limited supply to prevent any loss of its value due to inflation.
This study approaches Bitcoin from the framework of behavioural and financial economics using an approach from econophysics and data science.
Then, we processed language analyses to construct the predictive factor for Bitcoin prices.
This atypical behaviour opens the door to propose future work to model Bitcoin by the self-exciting process of the Hawkes model during times of great turbulence."
25,"This graph makes statistical evaluation of the free-format responses feasible, while preserving the diversity of respondents’ opinions that increases spontaneously as respondents express their own opinions.
In addition to the clustering of raw opinion graphs, we also considered annotated opinion graphs to achieve a higher resolution by adding more information externally through annotation.
In contrast, for the second and third surveys, opinion graphs were partitioned into two groups.
However, their resolution is insufficient, as the raw opinion graph is only classified into a few groups or not classified at all.
Fig 5 shows the response patterns of respondents that were obtained through the clustering of annotated opinion graphs.
We classified the opinions of respondents by aggregating the response patterns and annotations through graph clustering."
26,"The Kuwabara flow field is only valid in the region of high curvature close to the fiber surface, so determining λ is slightly more subtle.
All the above calculations used the approximate Kuwabara flow field to compute λ.
We performed LB simulations to check the validity of the Kuwabara approximation.
Kuwabara and LB values for λ are compared in Fig.
We note that, especially at small fiber volume fraction α, the Kuwabara approximation gives λ values close to those obtained by LB simulations.
So we conclude that at least under most conditions, the Kuwabara flow field yields good approximations for λ.
Fiber voxels have standard LB on-site bounce back52,53 to model stick boundary conditions for the air flow."
27,"Each node represents an individual whose strategy, at any time, is either cooperate or defect.
And so, lacking the mechanism of network reciprocity, we might expect that directed graphs cannot favor the evolution of cooperation.
One reason why directionality may have been neglected is that, a priori, unidirectional interactions would seem to only impede cooperation, because they remove the possibility of pairwise reciprocity (5–7).
In those two cases the effect of directionality is to repress cooperation.
But our analysis applies to arbitrary directed network structures and we find that, in general, directionality tends to favor cooperation.
The condition for cooperation also involves the coalescence times τij, obtained by solving the linear system of equations[13]τij={1+12∑k∈Npikτkj+12∑k∈Npjkτiki≠j,0i=j.
Angles such as those of cooperation theory are relevant to that dimension, but fall outside of the scope of this paper."
28,"We start by studying whether cooperation can be favored on strictly unidirectional networks, which contain no bidirectional edges.
4 and 5 for large k. In general, though, an intermediate proportion of unidirectional edges, namely p = 2/3, minimizes the benefit-to-cost ratio required for selection to favor cooperation (Fig.
In this section we explore the strategic assignment of edge orientations, to understand how this feature of network topology influences the evolution of cooperation.
Furthermore, even when a directed network with random orientations disfavors cooperation altogether, for any benefit-to-cost ratio, adjusting edge orientations to increase triangular cycles can rescue cooperation (Fig.
Yet we have found that, even for such networks, conversion of some bidirectional edges to unidirectional can rescue cooperation.

30,"Both VOIs and VOCs are likely to affect transmission, diagnostics, therapeutics, or immune escape (37).
There is uncertainty about the efficacy of available vaccines in relation to VOCs.
This can lead to selection for VOCs with transmission advantage or, in places with high rates of natural or vaccinal immunity, VOCs with escape mutations.
If VOCs with an ability to evade immune responses emerge, NPIs may need to be reinstated or strengthened even in populations where relatively high levels of immunity have been achieved.
Assuming increased international mobility due to, in particular, high vaccination coverage, a potential outbreak of a new VOC in one country may spread quickly to others.
In light of this danger, a joint effort of all European countries to prevent the emergence and circulation of VOCs seems crucial [118,119].
Any new VOCs might challenge a successful mitigation or containment strategy, and in case of increased mobility, they are likely to spread quickly."
31,"Sedimentation and aerosol dilution play crucial roles at large physical separations and so mask-wearing is not a substitute for physical distancing.
The filter efficiencies of most masks vary significantly with aerosol diameter.
These two filtering efficiencies are generally not equal because masks tend to leak more during exhalation than inhalation and aerosols have higher velocities on exhalation than inhalation.
The underestimation increases with increasing ρp and r, and decreases when wearing a mask that is more efficient at filtering large aerosols than small aerosols.
The largest aerosols have the greatest multiplicities, which means that a mask that filters them out better than small aerosols reduces the effect of ignoring multiplicity.
A mask that filters large aerosols better than small aerosols reduces the effect of ignoring multiplicity because larger aerosols have higher multiplicities.
But, they are wearing a mask which reduces the number of infectious aerosols that survive to reach the environment by a factor of 20–100 depending on the diameter."
32,"We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs by studying how parameters evolved in the different epidemiological periods.
Quantifying the effects of NPIs (12%): papers aimed at characterizing the effects of NPIs on epidemic indicators, behaviors and activities;5.
The authors consider also the effects of NPIs by using time-varying transmission and mortality rates.
Different surveys have been designed and deployed to capture the effect of NPIs on contacts and thus estimating the impact on the disease spreading.
Countries with active outbreaks have in general introduced NPIs to restrict mobility and reduce the number of personal contacts [3].
It is thus key to understand when NPIs can be lifted safely.
Once this ‘sweet spot’ has been reached, NPIs can be gradually loosened without risking an increase in fatalities."
33,"The second source of outliers is due to some participants performing measurements in correspondence of extraordinary events, instead of restraining to situations more representative of their normal environment.
Next, we consider the sensitivity of our result against the presence of influential outliers.
Method #3 is especially relevant in the case of outlier events.
Then, the datum is considered to be an outlier if the product of the probability and the number of data in the dataset is less than a given threshold.
The data in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures were considered as outliers from hierarchical clustering (see also [29]).
This subtype occurs when the time series consists of cycles—such as climatic seasons—that demonstrate similar patterns, with the discord following a different pattern [7, 16, 69, 189].
The term outlier refers to numerically isolated occurrences, such as the classical Type I and Type IVa-d cases."
34,"In the context of medical tests such as the tonometry, it is apparent that routine procedures can lead to droplets forming aerosols as well as fomites.
Active use of water in toilet flushing and washbasins can be a major source of droplets.
Next, we inject particles over the toilet seat to simulate toilet flushing that generates a large amount of droplets.
As a result, the risk of spatial dissemination of the droplets is not significantly modified compared to long exhalations.
Section 4 consists of a literature survey on droplet size distributions of respiratory origin.
In particular, to understand which droplets can stay airborne for long enough to be inhaled."
35,"This means that streamlines do not depend on the flow speed/pressure difference.
We then insert particles into the resulting steady flow field to evaluate their trajectories.
The Reynolds number for a flow with characteristic lengthscale L is

Re=ULν,
(1)where ν is the kinematic viscosity and U is the velocity.
For the velocity, we use the Darcy velocity, see Sec.
For flow that is just straight ahead, the particle will just follow the flow.
Streamlines are defined by velocities and accelerations and so one way to obtain the lengthscale is to square the velocity and divide by the acceleration.
The acceleration is that along the streamline, i.e., rate of change of streamline velocity while being advected along the streamline."
36,"In the present work, we investigated systematically the morphological and nanomechanical properties of microdroplet nuclei and their formation kinetics as a function of the surface in contact.
Fluorescence microscopy was carried out to identify the residues of the deposited microdroplets.
It offers the assurance to compare droplet nuclei formed on different substrates, with minimal variation in the droplet characteristics.
Morphology of the microdroplet nuclei with microscopic and nanoscopic spatial resolution was subsequently investigated using fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy, respectively.
The series of solid particulates confirm the robustness of the method in preparing the microdroplet nuclei.
To establish fine details of the microdroplet nuclei, AFM was deployed to survey different regions of the solid substrates, of which representative images are shown in figure 5.
The Young's modulus values are consistent with those acquired on polymer film [52], which further supports the proposed structure that mucin molecules present as the shell for the microdroplet nuclei."
37,"In general, capture efficiency is further enhanced by diffusion and inertia.
Inertial filtration becomes more important with increasing flow speeds, as the faster moving particles have more inertia.
Inertia has a small effect and the filtration is mainly through interception.
However, the difference is that the effect of inertia is to slightly decrease filtration.
Inertia at small Stokes number can make filtration a little less efficient.
However, at large Stokes number, we indeed find that inertia increases the filtration efficiency.
Surprisingly, over this size range, the effect of inertia is to decrease filtration efficiencies, although the effect is small.
Modest amounts of inertia decrease the filtration efficiency by pushing more particle trajectories away from collisions with fibers, than they do trajectories toward collisions."
38,"The greater the number of virions to which a person is exposed, V
e, the greater the number of chances that any given virion will successfully infect a cell.
Since this example scenario represents a well‐ventilated space (five air changes per hour), the virion concentration far from the infectious person is relatively low (approximately one virion per m3).
However, virion concentrations are orders of magnitude greater directly downwind of the infectious individual than in the rest of the room.
A susceptible person standing in the expiratory jet of an infectious person will be exposed to a large concentration of virions, even if they are in a well‐ventilated space.
Within this distance, local enhancements in virion concentrations increase transmission risk by more than 5%.
If a susceptible person moves far enough away, they can avoid the local increase in virion concentrations within the infectious person's expiratory jet.
The extent of underestimation varies depending on the relative positions of the infection source(s) and the ventilation outlet vent(s)."
39,"Univariate: Except for being part of the same set, no relationship between the variables exists to which the anomalous behavior of the deviant case can be attributed.
The anomaly needs to be described and detected by referring to the joint distribution, meaning the individual attributes cannot be studied separately.
In theory this is also an independent dimension, but in practice univariate data only contain atomic anomalies.
Multivariate data may also host aggregate anomalies, which alongside substantive attributes typically require data management attributes (e.g., time stamps or group designations) that allow the formation of collective structures.
However, like Type I and II anomalies, analyzing the attributes jointly is unnecessary because the case in question is not multivariately anomalous.
As with all multivariate anomalies, multiple attributes need to be jointly taken into account to describe and identify them.
data with mixed data types may also host aggregate anomalies.
Anomalies that require only qualitative or quantitative attributes are simpler than those defined in terms of mixed data."
40,"In contrast, binary classification makes a binary decision for every instance that needs a binary label.
In other words, the number of instances in need of binary labels equals the number of decisions.
Here training instances are not counted, because they already have binary labels.
It is worth emphasizing that a decision rule cannot be constructed if all training instances have the same label, say 0; hence, training data must contain both binary labels.
An easy check is to count the number of input instances needed to output each binary decision.
If we are expecting one decision per input instance, it is likely a binary classification task.
Otherwise, if each binary decision needs to be made from a group of instances together, the task cannot be binary classification but might be formulated as hypothesis testing.
If no changes are made to the parameters used to generate the binary mask, the algorithm will repeatably calculate identical metrics with no error on separate trials."

42,"This is a strong warning on the effectivity of the LLs.
Before an augmentation, it is recommended to consider the ’safety’ for the chosen domain.
On the other hand, caution is needed if conditions limit a researcher's choice to the use of lossy Zoom recordings as these can lead to erratic outcomes.
The dismantling and packaging work areas seem to neglect this important safety measure frequently.
To address this, we highlight a few situations where caution is advised, in practical settings.
The warning unfortunately manifested to be a well poised concern."

Antibody-dependent enhancement has been observed in dengue viruses, in which a past infection may in fact increase the risk of severe infection [12, 13].
Pk antigen also binds to adhesin P from Streptococcus suis, a pig pathogen that can cause meningitis in humans [105].
In addition, studies on antibody-dependent enhancement are conflicting, because antibodies ‘can enhance virus uptake by cells’ [6], but also ‘may also inhibit virus entry’ [7].
Antibody disease enhancement, analogous to what has been observed in Dengue fever [192], could in principle occur."
44,"These cells were grown to confluence (2–3 days) in a 24-well plate (250,000 cells per well).
Sample images were captured after 5 days of drying, using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71).
The cells were then washed with DPBS and observed under the fluorescence microscope.
The cells were counterstained with DAPI for nuclei and imaged using fluorescence microscopy.
Such matching is needed to allow imaging with fluorescence confocal microscopy.
They were confined in cells constructed using three coverslips on a microscope slide."
45,"We examine two AC load scenarios: energy-efficient equipment and baseline equipment per the International Energy Agency’s Future of Cooling study3.
Cooling is divided into two main categories: residential and commercial.
The ratio of commercial to residential consumption is computed from state-level data22 and is used as the ratio of commercial to residential cooling demand.
Surveyed hourly demand profiles20 are indicators of behavioral cooling energy consumption patterns as exemplified in Supplementary Figs.
We can generate the air conditioning demand profiles for two weather seasons (winter and summer) by convolution of the sample profiles to generate a smooth aggregated demand profile.
We break down the national cooling demand to residential and commercial at state level by identifying state-level sector size and growth trends.
Scaling the profiles to match the projected cooling energy demand produces hourly energy consumption profiles from residential and commercial cooling.
Finally, we compare our air conditioning demand contribution to the peak demand to the Future of Cooling study in Supplementary Fig."
46,"They showed a LOD of 4 nM and 2 pmol for the detection of thrombin.
In
addition, they also demonstrated the capability of detecting ssDNA
from serum with a LOD of 400 pM.
This one-step, wash-free, volume-based MPS detection scheme allows for
immunoassay on minimally processed biological samples and handling by
nontechnicians with minimum training requirements.
Serum is generated by
leaving whole blood at room temperature after collection for
about 30 min to clot.
Blood is then centrifuged to separate
clear serum from the clot.
For plasma, whole blood is collected
in a sterile tube containing an anticoagulant.
Plasma is then
separated from the remaining blood cells by centrifugation.
The samples need to undergo RNA extraction as well as an
amplification process which can take several hours and might degrade the diagnosis accuracy."
47,"A CG mapping is a representation of how atoms in a molecule are grouped to create CG beads.
Conventionally, a CG mapping for a molecule is selected using chemical and physical intuition.
They were also instructed to preserve the planar configuration of rings if possible by grouping rings into 3 or more beads.
(a), (b), (e)–(g) also show that when rings in molecules are grouped into three CG beads by the human annotators, DSGPM model is able to capture this pattern.
3d, the predicted mapping from Graclus method contain 1455 CG beads.
This shows that while DSGPM is capable of predicting state-of-the-art mapping for small molecules it can also be scaled to predict reasonable mappings for arbitrarily large structures."
48,"Coarse grained (CG) models can be viewed as a two part problem of selecting a suitable CG mapping and a CG force field.
In this work we focus on addressing the issue of CG mapping selection for a given system.
Once the CG mapping is selected, CG force field parameters required for the CG simulation can be determined via existing bottom-up1 or top-down2 CG methods.
Automation of CG mapping is important to enhance scalability and transferability.
The HAM database allows DSGPM to learn CG mappings directly from annotations.
We visualize the CG mapping prediction results against ground-truth in Fig.
In this work, we propose a novel DSGPM as a supervised learning method for predicting CG mappings."
49,"All the parameters were downloaded via the POWER API at the longitude and latitude coordinates matching the largest cities in each state that comprise above 10% of the state population.
Geographical coordinates of the cities and populations of cities and states were adapted from Wikidata (Wikipedia, 2021a, b).
Giving up geolocalization has an impact on the spatial resolution of the data.
Longitude and latitude are defined as angles on the surface of a sphere with longitude in the range [−90,90] and latitude in the range [−180,180].
Thus, geographic information of latitude and longitude have been integrated into our model.
The distribution of longitude and latitude of the study participants is presented in Fig.
Then, the city’s latitude and longitude were used to pull down the corresponding environmental data from the Nasa Merra-2 data set."
50,"It follows that, for all actions appeared in a certain time block j, the missing information are the actions appeared in the immediately previous time block (i.e.
After completing the sequential prediction (Fig 6C), we assembled the time segments associated with the same label into a corresponding event (Fig 6E).
We also derived the start and end times of each assembled event.
[266] assumed that the time delays are induced when nodes became aware and modified their behavior.
The time between two events between u and v is the interevent time [36].
The most important event type for our application is the timeout, which allows a process to sleep for the given time, determining the duration of the activity.
Events of this type are triggered after a certain amount of simulated time has passed.
An event is an activity that takes place at a specific physical location for a finite time.
This time was ascertained from the timing of the first button press, explained in the Experimental Protocol subsection."
51,"This idea stems from the observation that, for a particular complex, only a few conformations can lead to the lowest free energy.
MDS and MC searching were completed on each model for conformational sampling using methods previously described in the literature [57,58,64,65].
For example, MD is a popular approach for conformational sampling which is derived from Newtonian equations of motion and the concepts of statistical thermodynamics.
The free energies for the ensemble of conformations are analysed in a statistically robust manner, yielding precise free energy predictions for any given complex.
In addition to 3-D classification, multi-body refinement can be used to resolve local structural variability caused by conformational changes11.
It is worth noting that even for this simple system, the estimated particle conformation distribution includes some off-diagonal points, which will tend to be biased towards zero, the neutral conformation.
Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the method when the system contains a mixture of conformational and compositional heterogeneity."
52,"The methods in the first category, such as coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations [9, 10], usually provide reliable simulation results but require heavy computational resources, which limits their applicability [11].
By reconstructing the original conformations, a model is expected to capture the patterns of the biomolecular interactions between atoms and those between residues in the three-dimensional space.
Model manipulation was performed with Maestro (Macromodel, version 9.8, Schrodinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2010), or Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) [87].
The first (out of five) model returned by the server has been used as a starting conformation for the molecular dynamics simulation.
Although PB models, such as MD simulations, can explore conformational space to some extent, they can hardly achieve ergodicity, resulting in some of the potential new target structures remaining hidden.
It involves performing an ensemble of MD simulations followed by free energy estimation using a semi-empirical method called molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA)."
53,"Moreover, since the effectiveness of such interventions depends on high rates of user adoption, rapid uptake and participation are crucial.
Some specific models incorporating the underlying mechanisms that affect the behavioral adoption of individuals have also been established.Melnik et al.
Within the SAR model, there are many factors that potentially impact the behavior adoption.Wang et al.
A correlated cascades model was also proposed to predict users’ product adoption behavior.
This help-seeking behavior is affected by many factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, proximity to testing facilities, severity of symptoms, personality, and insurance coverage.
[363] confirms how adoption of health behaviors is linked to a range of factors, form socio-economic to psychological.
The adoption of health promoting behaviors is a complex phenomenon affected by many variables.
It is worthy of further investigation to account for individual preferences in their adoption choices when multiple interventions for disease mitigation are available."
54,"Replicated retrospective cohort studies offer the highest level of evidence prior to prospective studies (Burns et al., 2011).
We thus conducted a series of five retrospective cohort studies, spanning different populations, age groups, demographics, and countries.
Our main analysis employed federated analyses on the ARD cohort using pooled MarketScan and Optum results.
We conducted the same statistical analysis in each of the five cohorts.
Our main analysis, described in the following section, involves pooling the results from individual cohorts.
For the sake of completion, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–5 show results for each of the five individual cohorts.
Fisher’s exact test and the associated non-central hypergeometric distribution under the alternative provided the odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values (one-sided) reported for individual cohorts.
A future study should consider oversampling high-risk subgroups or regions to enable inference specific to those important populations."
55,"It remains an open problem to promote bottom-up behaviour and attitude changes for the greater good [65].
[26], we also suggest using factual normative messages and different interventions to reduce perceived barriers.
Both positive and negative experiences were found in each category of design characteristics.
Our results uncover 34 negative themes out of which 17 are economic, socio-political, educational, and political issues.
We discuss the negative issues and suggest interventions to tackle them based on the positive themes and research evidence.
Our results reveal 34 negative themes out of which 17 are economic, socio-political, educational, and political issues.
Twenty (20) positive themes were also identified.We suggest interventions to tackle the negative issues.
In this section, we suggest interventions that can help address the negative issues while drawing insights from the positive themes and relevant research evidence.
We discussed the economic, socio-political, educational, and political issues and suggested interventions to tackle them based on the positive themes and research evidence."
56,"The effects remain significant and stable in magnitude when we control for additional factors.
This yields a daily economical cost equal to A+B, according to (4).
The economical cost (b) is responsible for the slope of the curves in Fig.
Furthermore, CAM has been scaled by the ratio of respective populations, which makes the value at the maximum very similar for both regions.
In this case, using the law of large numbers, we have
Consequently, due to the nature of i.i.d Bernoulli trials, from the law of large numbers, we have
We thus set a threshold Δ so as to pick the suitable strings to approximate the law of large numbers, that is
Higher values for this adjustment factor result in a better adjustment in the small regions, but at the cost of a less rigorous adjustment in the larger regions."
57,"A schematic overview of our approach is depicted in Figure 1.
A schematic of the full task is shown in Figure 6.
We display an example output of the program in Fig 2.
Fig 1 shows the framework diagram where we highlight the major components.
The UPHO architecture is composed of three different layers (Figure 2): data, analytics, and application.
Here we have provided a detailed description of the design of the UPHO platform.
Figure 3 provides a schematic representation of the UPHO analytic framework, which comprises a 4-fold process."
58,"Two kinds of chimps with different autonomous categories named ChOA1 and ChOA2 out of a small number of evaluated methods had the best efficiency in the optimization tasks.
The attacker chimp leads the exploitation phase, and the hunt is now and then enrolled by the other chimps.
The first attacker, driver, barrier, and chaser are considered as the best chimps, and the other chimps should update their positions based on these four solutions.
Firstly, ChOA is initiated by producing random chimps (candidate solutions).
Secondly, all chimps are divided into four mentioned autonomous categories.
Thirdly, chimps update their f vectors using the assigned categorize strategy.
Afterward, the four-categorized chimps evaluate the locations of practicable prey during the iteration.
Then, the distances between chimps and the prey will be updated.
In fact, the values of weight and bias are used as searching agents (Chimps) in the ChOA."
59,"Before this event, none of us had worked together: we assembled around a common shared vision.
As shown in Fig 1, 21% of responses noted useful or important aspects of Access, and 33% noted aspects that were desired or lacking.
33% of responses highlighted useful and important aspects of Content, and 30% mentioned lacking or desired aspects.
Content display received slightly more lacking/desired than useful/important mentions (14% and 9% of responses, respectively).
Initiation & Editing was the most positively mentioned of the eight factors, with 66% of responses mentioning useful and important aspects; 31% of responses mentioned lacking or desired aspects.
In the present data, 13% of responses mentioned useful or important Social aspects, and 9% mentioned desired or lacking aspects.
Meanwhile, 21% of mentions pointed to lacking or desired aspects of Engagement.
Others felt engaged, but felt that others were not matching their level of involvement."
60,"Text responses from the present sample highlighted positive and negative aspects of Content that emerge during CP co-curation.
One aspect of CPs distinguishing them from many other online collaborations is the ensuing consumption by collaborators during and even after the collaboration.
Our present findings with CPs highlight the need to accommodate a wider range and variety of such consumption practices.
Users’ experiences of CPs go beyond co-creation to consumption as well, whether individually or as a group.
CP designs providing better experiences for users’ consumption can further inspire design for co-curation and consumption (i.e., post-production) experiences of other collaborative artifacts as well.
Learning from research on change awareness [60] with mechanisms such as those for version control [54] to increase granularity in visibility of editing would be helpful.
Future work can apply the codebook to study different types of CP users or use cases."
61,"The project is part of the Bavarian Research Association on Healthy Use of Digital Technologies and Media (ForDigitHealth), funded by the Bavarian Ministry of Science and Arts.
The presence of data‐driven techniques can be considered a prevention strategy for any interruption–e.g.
Our review found many major ICT interventions around the globe [11]–[13], [20], [21].
Therefore, we believe this is one potential area where digital intervention may be useful.
Third, we think timely and up-to-date data are the key to most of the digital interventions that we have identified in this paper.
Here, we find two reviews that highlight the incredible opportunities offered by digital technologies to capture behaviors, their changes and inform modeling as well as policies [364], [365]."
62,"This research studies interoperability of digital health solutions and the benefits from integration of these systems.
The second objective and a point of interest in this paper was to review predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare solutions.
The aim of this objective was to promote research that prevents failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions has led to lack of interoperability.
Hence, the review includes case studies that investigate different interoperable digital healthcare systems.
A diverse set of non-contact digital healthcare technologies are investigated in case studies from different regions in the world.
Apart from the multiple benefits identified for future global pandemic management, the review does not identify any new or unaccounted cyber risks from developing these interoperable digital healthcare solutions.
Adding to this, the review study concludes that such global systems for pandemic management should also be designed as interoperable and coupled with existing digital non-contact healthcare systems.
Therefore, the interoperability across different healthcare sectors has been improved.
To provide and develop healthcare, an objective such as ICT is appropriate."
63,"Besides, we were able to identify and keep track of groups of pedestrians (i.e., co-walkers who appear to be relatives, co-workers, or friends) by visual inspection.
As we shall see below, the blame does not necessarily rest on the pedestrian, but rather on the ebbs and flows of crowding in each observed situation.
Prior to that, let us remark that accounting for the directionality of droplet propagation and describing the orientations of pedestrians’ heads had a marked effect on our results.
This assumption requires from a crowd model the information concerning the pedestrian trajectories over time and the dimension of the agents.
This is implemented by checking the coordinate in spaces of the pedestrians and evaluating if they are within the given radius of interaction.
This assumption requires from a crowd model the information concerning the pedestrian trajectories over time (e.g."
64,"This approach is
not
an attempt to redefine and build a semantic network (in the usual sense), or an entity relationship network, such as Google’s Knowledge Graph.
Neural tensor networks can be used for knowledge base completion, inferring relationships that were missed during construction (Socher et al., 2013a).
Embedding knowledge: Medical domain knowledge can be exploited to solve specific problems by creating networks that seek to mimic the way medical doctors analyse medical data [186].
Finally, researchers may consider applying several emerging network analysis paradigms such as network embedding, heterogeneous network representation, and knowledge graphs [76–78].
The study models the propagation of each statement as a tree structure.
The knowledge graph is a semantic network that reveals the relationships between entities.
In the knowledge graph, entities are represented as nodes, and the relationships between these nodes are described as edges.
Knowledge graphs are widely used through entity links, such as movie recommendation ([117]), machine reading ([113]), text classification ([99]), etc.
The ontology will provide contextual knowledge that will help perform semantic inference."
65,"In the study, the news propagation tree structure in research of [67] was converted into time.
The tree structure information is disturbed in the research, and the dependence is obtained from user comments between different conversation threads.
However, this study only compares the structural similarity between propagation trees.
Compared to [65], this method does not require comparison the structure of propagation tree.
However, although their approach can link the branch information of different propagation trees, it destroys the structure of the propagation tree and cannot use structural features.
Although they ([65],[67], [52], [47]) use structure and content information, not every propagation path is essential."
66,"(Step 4) Investigate local and global spatial autocorrelation for each component.
We provide quantitative analysis to show that the weights of these latent features are strongly spatially auto-correlated with a number of significant spatial clusters.
We found a strong positive spatial autocorrelation for all three features.
The spatial autocorrelation of PC1 and PC2 at 0.556 and 0.544, respectively, is higher than the spatial autocorrelation of PC3 at 0.489.
For all three components, the positive spatial autocorrelation is highly significant at p-values ≪ 10−28 having Z-scores of 46 and greater.
As we suspected from our qualitative analysis, this result confirms that the patterns of ΔTSPP that we observed in Fig 5 are indeed strongly positively spatially autocorrelated.
The experiment shows that the spatial autocorrelation is indeed insignificant in Hubei Province (Limited to the space of the paper, the relevant issues will be discussed separately)."
67,"Therefore, quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions and their timings.
The identification of such thresholds is essential to quantify the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions (21).
We have also assumed that the effect of the non-pharmaceutical interventions is uniform across age-groups.
[352] reviews the evidence about the efficacy and challenges of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions.
[

23

] Hinch et al.formulated an open‐source agent‐based modeling framework to support the analysis of select non‐pharmaceutical interventions and contact tracing schemes.
The question of how to assess the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical measures is analysed in Section 5.
In what follows, we enumerate the most relevant non-pharmaceutical interventions, focusing on different research works that assess their efficacy."
68,"7, sensors as well as cameras can detect, identify, and count the number of customers in a restaurant, consequently offering early warnings of an overcrowded environment.
In KPR, the prospective players (customers/agents) choose from restaurants each day (time) in parallel decision mode, based on the past (crowd) information and their own (evolved or learned) strategies.
Each restaurant has the same price for a meal but having a different rank, agreed upon by all the customers or players.
If more than one customer arrives at any restaurant on any day, one of them is randomly chosen and is served, and the rest do not get meal that day.
Each day, based on own learning and the developed (often mixed) strategies, each customer chooses a restaurant independent of the others.
Each customer wants to go to the restaurant with the highest possible rank while avoiding a crowd so as to be able to get the meal there."
69,"At the time of writing, many UK supermarkets advise or restrict customers to shop alone [21].
In line with UK government guidelines [30], many stores restrict the maximum number Cmax of customers in a store.
We can add this restriction to our model by simulating a queue outside of the store, where customers queue up if we have Cmax or more customers in the store.
Customers from the queue only enter the store when the number of customers in the store is below Cmax.
Another way of reducing the number of customers in the store is to restrict the rate at which customers enter the store.
Note that restricting Cmax is equivalent to reducing the arrival rate λ, as both methods reduce the rate at which customers enter the store.
The customers enter the supermarket through a single entrance in the lower left corner while they exit via multiple cashiers on the lower right corner."
70,"Female scientists reported that their ability to devote time to their research has been substantially affected, and the impact is most pronounced for female scientists with young dependents [14].
As a result, the research productivity of female scientists appears to have decreased [15-18].
Further, we explored whether there were any commonalities among the countries with respect to the participation of women in research.
Since research in the biomedical field usually takes longer to conduct and publish, it could lead to a shift in the gender distribution later.
Sudden lockdowns and other preventive measures unevenly increased the burden on certain populations, causing the productivity of female scientists to decrease.
The factors that led to such extreme and consistent differences in the proportion of female scientists can be numerous.
The already existing barriers for female participation in science vary across countries.
All the difficulties female scientists faced previously may possibly be exacerbated by the extended lockdowns and sudden shift in work-life dynamics."
71,"For example, doctors diagnose new patients based on previous patients' data with diagnosis decisions.
The Swedish National Patient Register differed from the MarketScan and Optum databases in several key ways that motivated slight modifications to the analysis.
The training, testing, and application steps for patient data analysis are detailed in flowcharts with text commentary.
The algorithm for processing a patient’s data is shown in Figure 5.
At the beginning, a feature vector of a patient’s medical data is obtained.
The database contains a set of features for each patient, presented in Table 3.
The algorithm for processing patient data is shown in Figure 5.
In this way, medical professionals can obtain the processed data with the easy observed form, and provide prediction as well as treatment advice faster and better.
With the permission of the patient, the algorithms and programs for the assessment of expected diagnosis and rehabilitation progress can be run on the data management equipment.
Section 3 presents the development of the proposed methodology, while Section 4 summarises its implementation and the description of clinical datasets."
72,"Nonetheless, the proposed framework demonstrated promising performance in identifying positive and negative cases.
In addition to the occurrence of false positives and false negatives (i.e.
When discussing this, we must consider that all test methods have false positive rates and false negative rates [26], even though they may be small.
This concerns false-positive and false-negative rates as well as biases in the measurement sample (p≠q).
[

34

] The outcomes of a test can be true positive or negative or false positive or negative.
If a positive result is reported then it is specific but neutral if no result is reported.
A false positive is associated with implementing unnecessary countermeasures, while a false negative is associated with violating pollution regulations.
True positive and true negative are right answers, but false positive and false negative are wrong answers."
73,"The microscope platform we use is a hardware and software system called Evaluation Environment for Digital and Analog Pathology (eeDAP).
[53] The system uses a computer-controlled motorized stage and digital camera mounted to a microscope.
eeDAP software registers the location of what is seen in the physical tissue through the microscope to the corresponding location in a WSI.
Registration enables the evaluation of the same ROIs in both the digital and microscope domains.
The primary platform at the event was the eeDAP microscope system where 7 pathologists made 440 evaluations.
The increased time for microscope evaluation was due to the motorized stage movements.
We trained study administrators to operate eeDAP and assist pathologists with data collection at the microscope.
There are opportunities to set up their own eeDAP microscope system or borrow an existing system from us."
74,"Recent applications of machine learning (ML) have gained popularity in the medical domain [14], [15].
Machine learning may be the key to realizing the vision of AI in medicine sketched several decades ago7.
Few clinical questions come as well-posed discrimination tasks that can be naturally framed as machine-learning tasks.
Contrasting more clinically-oriented venues to more technical venues can reveal opportunities for machine learning research.
Despite great promises, the extensive research in medical applications of machine learning seldom achieves a clinical impact.
We have surveyed challenges of clinical machine-learning research that can explain these difficulties.
But implementing them will help fulfilling the promises of machine-learning in healthcare: better health outcomes for patients with less burden on the care system."
75,"In this work, we overview the approaches proposed in the surveyed Machine Learning articles and indicate typical errors emerging from the lack of deep understanding of the radiography domain.
Convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is one of the most prominent deep learning techniques in the medical imaging field, with outstanding results [18].
In medical image processing, as in many other areas, deep learning approaches have demonstrated excellent results in past years [33].
However, considering the comprehensive application of deep learning to digital pathology (WSI), readers are referred to a complementary survey that thoroughly covers the potential applications of GCN to WSI [26].
This type of CAD visualization introduces a secondary but useful opinion for the medical specialists and radiology experts to improve their understandings of deep learning models.
Therefore, this indicates the ability of deep learning methods in the analysis of medical images."
76,"The next problem is related to the mixture of images of patients of different ages.
An additional problem is that, from a medical point of view, some images should be multi-categorized.
Note that in medical imaging we refer to the number of subjects, but a subject may have multiple images, for example, taken at different points in time.
The study was developed using images taken from 157 patients, from China and USA.
For our pilot study, we included eight batches of eight cases each; a case refers to the slide image pair.
In clinical practice, experts review medical images by zooming into ROIs for a close-up examination.
In detail, the images were collected by the Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center, and they were graded by at least two expert physicians.
In particular, these images were acquired by different institutions across the world and include both male and female patients covering all ages up to 80 years old."

78,"To put the performance of the DLS in context, two independent board-certified radiologists reviewed the test splits of both DS-1 and CXR-14.
Lastly, for DS-1 and CXR-14, every image was independently reviewed by 3 radiologists to form the reference standard.
In CXR-14, the binary abnormal labels were derived through an automated natural language processing (NLP) algorithm on the radiology report7.
For the test sets of DS-1 and CXR-14, a group of US board-certified radiologists reviewed the images at their original resolution to provide reference standard labels.
For CXR-14, we obtained labels from three US board-certified radiologists (years of experience: 5, 12, and 24).
Finally, there are some studies that have carried out a type of EPS parallel to those commissioned by TTCs to verify their veracity14,15."

[60], lung ultrasound is considered a suitable modality for the diagnosis of COVID-19 due to its non-radiation nature.
[81] also believe that lung ultrasound can show the severity and involvement of the lung in COVID-19.
Although CT imaging seems to be promising for diagnosing COVID-19, lung ultrasound is also a suitable modality in certain conditions, such as pregnancy.
According to claim [82], lung ultrasound in four pregnant women could detect COVID-19 and its main features are B-lines and irregular pleural lines."

81,"SUMMARY: The CoV-Spectrum website supports the identification of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and the tracking of known variants.
The website offers users a convenient way to assess the available SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data together with its metadata.
Such a minimal difference enforces the hypothesis that the apparent higher fitness of SARS-CoV-2 lies elsewhere.
As reported by Cannalire et al.63 and Zhang et al.,8 the volume of the S2 subpocket in SARS-CoV Mpro is very similar to that of the MERS-CoV homologue.
Since estimates of prior and current prevalence are relevant to policy, seroprevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 are becoming increasingly important and more frequently conducted.
The frequency and the spectrum of variants of SARS-CoV-2 will depend on functional constraints and evolutionary pressure."
82,"In their framework, the distributed proxy re-encryption method and the corresponding re-encryption contract are utilized.
Due to the limited storage capacity of IoMT, the lightweight cryptographic operations in BCeMT are investigated.
In [9], the authors designed an authenticated key management protocol for a BCeMT environment with lightweight cryptographic operations.
Storage and computation capability constraints may limit the widespread applications of BCeMT architecture.
In the sensitive healthcare domain, the legal regulations on the BCeMT are required to explicitly define the nodes, users, peers and validators of the blockchain.
The adoption of BCeMT architecture needs to be backed by legal instruments.
In the BCeMT system, the architecture is distributed and the blockchain-based encryption operations ensure the security and privacy of medical data.
We then present the architecture of BCeMT and elaborate on the opportunities brought by BCeMT.
The applications of BCeMT include the prevention of infectious diseases, location sharing and contact tracing, and the supply chain of injectable medicines."
83,"Smart contracts share similar characteristics to the blockchain, such as distribution, decentralization, and immutability.
Once a smart contract is deployed, no one can modify it, ensuring the security of transactions and systems.
For an instance, Ethereum implements smart contracts in various computer languages like Solidity, Serpent, or LLL [36].
When a smart contract is called, it will run immediately in the content of an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on the decentralized network computers.
A smart contract is a programmable application that runs on a blockchain network.
The term “smart contract” was defined by Nick Szabo as “a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract.
Blockchain nodes within the network can execute the smart contract and derive the same results from the execution, which are reflected and recorded on the blockchain."
84,"We propose an independent way to estimate the true incidence of SARS-CoV-2.
All data processed in this study is published on a public forum [12], as part of a challenge to accelerate approaches to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
For our 2-class (SARS-CoV-2 positive vs negative) classification we employ several machine learning and artificial network models.
A second example case is presented in Appendix A, analyzing the situation in Austria during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in early April 2020.
With the knowledge that we now have acquired about the spreading of SARS-CoV-2, more targeted restrictions may yield a similarly strong effect.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has thus far been extremely difficult to contain."
85,"The computational cost is not negligible for systems with a large number of agents, however nowadays this is not a strong limitation due to the increase of computational power.
The computational cost of the methodology can quickly escalate since each ensemble member consists of a whole agent population.
However, there is much room for improvement because several tasks may be parallelized (at the agent population level and also at the ensemble level).
The computational cost can be very high, especially for small time steps and large agent numbers.
As soon as there are second-order interactions, the effort does not scale linearly with the number of agents.
The effort is much lower than for ABM-simulations but still scales at least linearly with the number of agents.
We analyzed the approximation quality as well as efficiency, finding that for large numbers of agents the PDMM delivers convincing results combined with enormous decrease in computational effort.
This created the need for a simpler, but technically suitable machine that could be mass produced on a very large scale and in a short timeframe.
As the number of activated agents increases so does the computational expense."
86,"The resilience of a system is its ability to maintain its functions when some errors and attacks occur, or some environmental and dynamical parameters are changed [320].
To date, extant literature on the human aspects of power grid resiliency is very poor.For example, Jufri et al.
Reference [41] reviews some of the ideas related to human resource resilience.
A vector of recover resilience indicators is formed (R=[Td,Cr,τ,CLr,SO]) for each path.
For each path, the vector R is computed, and the analytical hierarchical process [119] is applied to find the composite resilience score.
Resilience is maximally enabled when the operator selects a path with the highest resilience metric score.
Figure 6 shows the main operator screen with the resilience metrics calculations.
Three routes are analysed using the resilience metrics analysis, and the most resilient option that is also the safest is chosen.
As observed over the last several years, the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme events and their associated impact on the power grid have been increasing."
87,"An increasing number of countries, municipalities, sectors, and individual firms adopted so-called “carbon neutrality” or zero emissions, for mid-century.
We implicitly assume a globally connected emission market (or a global emission tax system) for CO2, CH4, and N2O.
Projections of future anthropogenic CO2 emissions are deeply uncertain; there is no consensus about the probability distribution of future emissions (Ho et al.
The potential role of negative emissions technologies (NETs) is another deep uncertainty that directly affects projected emissions trajectories.
This illustrates a challenge of constructing parsimonious models for projecting emissions.
From the perspective of managing climate risk, emissions projections and forecasts should be understand in the context of these large climate-system uncertainties."
88,"Its popularity may be related to the fact that colorful heat maps are easy to implement and seem to be readable.
The heatmap plots provide us with an intuitive visual guide for understanding the degree of interconnectedness between provinces in terms of their bidirectional travel volume (figure 2).
We describe the main features of the heat map, moving from left to right through time.
The murder of George Floyd on May 25 and subsequent Black Lives Matter protests then leads to a sharp transition in the heat map.
A heatmap of the cumulative confirmed cases is presented in Fig.
The first point we observe by investigating these heatmaps is the change in pc or the outbreak threshold.
Moreover, the intensities of the heatmap visualizations confirmed that there were two separate echo chambers."
89,"To compensate for any imbalance between our sample and the general population demographic distributions, we employed raking as a post-stratified weighting technique.
Raking is an iterative method that calculates weights for each joint demographic group until convergence [31].
After obtaining estimates of each country’s age and sex distributions from the United Nation’s 2019 World Population Prospects dataset, we used raking for calculating each response’s weight.
This technique was employed for each country, resulting in weights for each sex, age group, and country triple in our dataset.
Weighting techniques like raking compensate for this discrepancy and help obtain a more accurate population-level estimation [31].
Additionally, our weighting technique, i.e., raking, might be associated with issues like non-convergence under some conditions [54, 55]."
90,"30 arbitrary trajectories were generated with SALib, a Python library that contains a Morris-Elementary-Effect toolkit.
We have not made this into a full Python library because research building on this codebase would most likely need to add functionality on a low level.
For the implementation of the BiCM, we used the recently released python module NEMtropy, presented in [80].
The GUI is written in Python3 using the PyQt5 library.
This software was created using a Jupyter Notebook (Perez & Granger, 2007), as well as SciPy (Virtanen et al., 2020), NumPy (Harris et al., 2020), and Matplotlib (Hunter, 2007).
The code developed in this study is written in the Python programming language using Keras/TensorFlow (Python) libraries."
91,"In Section 4 a research methodology for network traffic anomalies detection model development is proposed.
The methods based on the sample apply the comparison of the incoming traffic with the pre-defined profiles and samples of the known network anomalies [9].
Observed from the communication network aspect, anomalies can occur in the network data traffic that occurs as a result of the communication activities of terminal or network devices.
This phase encompasses the development of the network traffic anomalies detection model.
In solving such a problem, the objective is to check the generated new traffic sample congruence with the sample of the legitimate traffic.
The following activity is the development of network anomaly detection model using the supervised machine learning methods."
92,"The control of man-made technological systems, such as power grids, supply networks, interconnected autonomous vehicles, and swarms of robots, is supported by sensing and communication infrastructure.
In order to better understand this affirmation, let us consider the example of the cluster “Remote Control”.
However, saying that “Remote Control” is the intersection of “Internet of Things” and “Cybersecurity” is not totally correct.
Therefore, one interpretation we can give is that the “Remote Control” cluster is half coming from the “Internet of Things” and “Cybersecurity” and the other half is totally new.
Remote control includes all technologies for the operation of machines and equipment at a distance, under strict conditions of controllability and safety.
The Remote control cluster benefits from inputs of IoT and Cybersecurity.
Under Remote control, in fact, a distributed network of home-based computers must be habilitated to interact with central manufacturing operations.
Although the two technologies are not the same, Remote control is facilitated by the level of robotisation of plants."
93,"The analysis considers and discusses the problem of flash crowd appearance and DDoS in the same scenario.
Flash crowd represents a legitimate event or series of legitimate events or network traffic unusually high intensity that can disrupt the availability of online service or communication resources.
The presented data indicate the occurrence of the flash crowd phenomenon.
Some authors research solutions that can differentiate flash crowd and DDoS traffic by using human behavior and interaction, but such solutions are not acceptable to users [52].
Flash crowd and DDoS traffic generation is planned with the implementation of the dedicated hardware platform.
Such a platform can simulate realistic flash crowd and DDoS traffic and provide advanced management and define features of the generated traffic at different OSI layers (Open Systems Interconnection) model."
94,"Second, resources like processing capacity and battery life available in smartwatches are low.
It is challenging to run such models on the smartwatches with low latency in order to provide real-time feedback.
Third, different smartwatches have different amounts of resources as well as different numbers of other applications that need to share the resources.
The tiny display of a smartwatch is also not suitable in providing detailed assessment results to the users.
Smartwatches have limited resources in terms of computation and energy.
Moreover, smartwatches are very effective for notifying the user in all situation.
The app collects readings from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors of the smartwatch with 50Hz sampling rate.
In our implementation, the network bandwidth between the smartwatch and the server was 1 Gbps.
It runs on a smartwatch with minimal processing time and battery usage facilitating real-time feedback to the user."
95,"In particular, when the user performs the handwashing steps, it involves movements of the wrists, which is captured by the IMU (Inetial Motion Unit) sensors of the smartwatch.
iWash provides daily handwashing reminders to the user between 9 AM to 9 PM.
The user can do so by simply asking iWash to remind him after a specific number of minutes.
During each session, the participant wore the smartwatch on the right hand with the data collection app running on it and then performed a handwashing event.
The implementation of iWash requires a smartwatch and a proximity Bluetooth beacon.
The iWash smartwatch application was developed on the watchOS platform and the trained optimized model (Section 5.2) was integrated with it.
During testing, each participant did 1 session wearing the smartwatch with the iWash application installed.
When the user performs handwashing, the smartwatch sends the handwashing data to the server."
96,"A lower CT therefore corresponds to a higher viral load.
The cycle threshold Ct defines the minimum number of PCR cycles at which amplified viral RNA becomes detectable.
Large values of Ct indicate low viral loads in the specimen.
An increase in Ct by a factor of about 3.3 corresponds to a viral load that is about one order of magnitude lower [2].
Lower Ct cutoffs in the range of 30–35 may be more reasonable to avoid classifying individuals with insignificant viral loads as positive [3].
The viral loads were reported in cycle threshold (Ct) values, which is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the viral RNA copy number (log⁡(V)=−0.3231Ct+14.11) [35].
In model fitting, viral load values under the detection threshold were set at the detection limit (Ct = 38)."
97,"2, where all state variables are candidates for sensor placement (i.e., K=X).
We stress that the proposed function (5) is limited to items (a) and (b), while other presumably important arguments could have been left aside for simplicity.
Formally, we define the following sets, input parameters, and decision variables.
An example of such a function is depicted in Fig.
In Section 7 we present conditions involving the system parameters that allow one to easily determine whether the sets are trivial or not.
Proposition 7.1 provides easily checkable inequalities of the system parameters that may be used to determine whether the sets are trivial or not.
In addition to the conditions common to the two sets, there were conditions that differentiated the two.
This formulation allows functions to be constructed using combinations of simple rules.
For example, we could define a function  as the following(6)where .
2B are generated by randomly selecting a position and variant following a uniform distribution.
For the following definitions let x1,…,xn≥0 denote n non-negative variables, and let x=(x1,…,xn)."
98,"Surprisingly, we also get dishwater detergent which is not intuitive as to its relation with influenza.
This corresponds to a more accurate approximation for the description of the disease etiology of influenza.
Let us consider a large epidemic of equine influenza (i.e.
In 1971, a nationwide epidemic of equine-2 influenza A (H3N8) was observed in Japan [115].
For example, in Niigata Racecourse, 580 influenza cases were diagnosed with influenza among a total of 640 susceptible horses.
This was the approach adopted by L&S and is commonly assumed by health departments during conventional influenza seasons.
Since the early 20th century, influenza viruses have been described as having marked variability and unpredictable behaviour [1].
Common influenza has been recorded, but only at fixed points (hospitals), making proper comparison difficult [39]."
99,"A first-tier static analysis focusing on apps’ permissions and API calls is given in section 3.
However, in this case, instead of providing a baseline, which is considered impractical, this section only identifies certain API calls that may pose a threat to user privacy.
Precisely, the focus is on the following list of API calls:
As already pointed out, API calls per app have been also extracted with the aim of identifying certain call to methods which may pose a threat to the user’s privacy.
Specifically, the API calls listed in section 3.1 have been grouped in Table 4 into three categories, namely cellular network, location, and camera.
Static taint analysis, i.e., a form of information flow analysis, has been performed with the aid of the Ostorlab tool.
Overall, an approximately 15% of the taint analysis results were found to be common between the two sets.
For instance, despite that all apps contain at least one location-related API call, about half (13) of them actually instantiate the relevant classes."
100,"This subsection reports on third-party trackers that may be utilized by each app.
“Crash reporters” focus on the crashes that may occur during the normal operation of the app.
App analysis revealed that 7 apps only employ Firebase [71] or other Google analytics service as a means to measure users’ engagement with them.
On top of that, 17 apps were found to be free of any tracker, which certainly is on the plus side.
The first tracker creates an automatic report, which includes any required information related to an app crash.
In that regard, this tracker is categorized as crash reporter."
101,"Complementary to the live event, we also planned a poster session, held on Twitter starting on January 9.
The call for abstracts for oral presentations or online posters was promoted via various social media, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram, as well as emails to colleagues.
This demand motivated the idea of a Twitter poster session.
We provided a four-slide poster template that was optimized for display on Twitter.
We asked the presenters to create a personal or group Twitter account (if they didn’t already have one), post their poster, and add a short description.
Compared to conventional conferences, the posters on Twitter had a much wider reach, with some reaching 4000 views.
While this was not a typical ‘wine and cheese’ poster viewing, the posters were viewable for days, and can still be found by looking up the hashtag.
Despite an exhaustive search, we were unable to find universally accessible web platforms that met our needs for both the poster session and the online presentations.
Our virtual poster session was held entirely on Twitter via a specially designed poster format."
102,"Adapting the Skills Space method, we develop a leading indicator for emerging technology adoption and potential labor market disruptions based on skills data, using AI as an example.
We select AI because of its potential impacts on transforming labor tasks and accelerating job transitions [2, 4, 6].
Our indicator temporally measures the similarity between a dynamic set of a AI skills against the 19 Australian industry skill sets from 2013–2019.
Using the Skills Space method, we construct each industry as a set of skills for every year and use Eq (4) to calculate similarity to the yearly AI skill sets.
By adapting the Skills Space method, we develop a leading indicator that detects AI adoption from real-time job ads data.
Such a measure can act as an ‘early warning’ signal of forthcoming labor market disruptions and accelerated job transitions caused by the growth of AI.
This acts as an ‘early warning system’ of forthcoming labor disruptions caused by the adoption and diffusion of AI within industries."
103,"We also highlight the challenges that need to be addressed and important research directions that will facilitate accelerated IoT adoption.
Furthermore, for each of these sectors, we also discuss new initiatives that are being taken, challenges that need to be addressed and important research directions that will facilitate IoT adoption.
The challenges that must be addressed and important research directions to facilitate accelerated IoT adoption are discussed in Section 4.
Moreover, existing enablers and barriers in adopting IoT-based healthcare have also been enlisted.
Finally, we discuss new IoT initiatives taken in different sectors, and present the challenges that need to be addressed to facilitate IoT adoption.
There are various other changes in regulations and procedures that are accelerating the adoption of IoT.
Furthermore, we highlight various challenges that must be addressed and important research directions that need attention to facilitate accelerated IoT adoption in different sectors."
104,"If we denote by wj the incidence within age class j over a short observation interval (e.g.
They also provide sensible and equitable benchmarks based on readily‐available demographic information (e.g., census data) and epidemiological information (e.g., case counts), hence easily implementable.
High seroprevalence, also in this age group, reduces the severity of this effect for the Czech Republic (Fig 5H).
This may be the consequence of the higher proportion of severe cases observed in Italy compared to other countries, which strictly relates to the older age-structure characterizing this country.
The sharp threshold ηc of long-survival is increased under all interventions, see Fig.
Prevalence in this age groups is drastically reduced by the two weeks closure and brought at a lower level than other age classes.
In this case, a low incidence would still mean a large number of cases in younger age groups.
This incidence in the total population would then correspond to a three-fold higher incidence in those under 30 years old."
105,"Labor market shocks, such as those caused by COVID-19, force workers to abruptly transition between jobs.
In Fig 5, we showcase its usage in the context of a labor market crisis (i.e.
The Job Transitions Recommender System could therefore assist with the current labor crisis caused by COVID-19.
The rapid onset of the crisis has meant that researchers have had to source and analyse real time labour market information.
This is to attempt to detect any change in common job titles induced by COVID.
This is a simple and transparent way to study the effect of economic shocks and major government interventions on labour market activity across employment sectors and geographies.
It in clear, in fact, that after having experienced the benefits of WFH, most workers will ask to continue even after the Covid crisis [79,80]."
106,"The Chinese government put several mitigation policies in place to suppress the spread of
the epidemic (17).
Because the epidemic in China was readily contained, the average distance dt saturated.
The data trends reveal that quick and active strategies taken by China to reduce human exposure have already had a good impact on the control of the epidemic.
Especially, with the implementation of the Chinese government’s multiple epidemic control policies, the control of nationwide epidemic has become obvious.
This is most likely due to the harsh containment measures adopted by the Chinese government in order to curb the spread of the disease.
Chinese authorities have tackled the outbreak by imposing martial law to a large fraction on the population, thus presumably cutting down the infection rate to a large extent.
Both the Chinese government and the Chinese media remained silent as to the risk of a possible epidemic."
107,"After testing positive, its four nearest neighbors are quarantined and queued for testing.
For every new positive case, the quarantining and testing procedure is continued.
Upon the positive test result, the status is switched to R and its neighbors are quarantined and queued for testing.
If the result is positive, then the people in contact with the patient are quarantined.
In our framework, individuals can be tested (and subsequently quarantined if tested positive) by three different mechanisms.
Third, all the close contacts of those individuals recently tested positive by the two mechanisms mentioned above would also be tested."
108,"The employment data used for this research is drawn from the ‘Quarterly Detailed Labor Force’ statistics by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) [21].
Future work could look to incorporate these additional variables to help further explain and predict job transitions.
The job market in the US has probably been the most extensively studied.

Fig 5 shows ‘graduate’ jobs, i.e., vacancies for graduates entering the workforce via job training or recruitment schemes.
In this section I investigate if there has been any change in the frequency of different contract types, modes of employment, or distribution of salaries.
Job vacancy data tells us about the amount of hiring but not firing.
Figure 12 shows the distribution of the percentage of workers either self- or informally employed."
109,"Having found how sources are associated with mean comfort, we can examine how often each source is mentioned in a given population density environment.
Analyzing levels and sources by population density (S10 Fig in S1 File) clarifies two aspects.
These dynamics can vary across different regions as they depend on parameters, such as pollution, demographic density, average age of the population, among others.
Population density (concentration of population in a certain area) used in this study is merely an indicator of one aspect of social distancing.
Additionally, it considered the influence of population density and composition.
The ambient factor was normalized by population density as aforementioned.
Eq 3 recognises a linear relationship between the indicator density and population density."
110,"The IoT is expected to make it possible for everyone to access and provide a vast amount of information about equipment and locations in the future.
The key potency of the IoT concept is the strong effect it would have on numerous diverse sides of daily life and future users’ behavior [18].
The IoT slams it into those cracks and then places it right where people want to look at our globe.
The development fields generated by the IoT are more distinct.
In the future, the IoT will become an open network and also non-deterministic in the structure of intelligence.
The goal or target of the IoT is to create a combination of the computer-generated and physical worlds in many areas."
111,"USC also provided technical support ahead of and throughout the event.
Each speaker performed a test run with the IT support team at USC.
The speakers were asked to be online and ready to present on the video-conferencing software at the start of the conference.
This way, in the event of a technical glitch, we could immediately proceed to the following speaker, which we did for a speaker who was unable to share their screen.
Questions from the audience were typed into the Webex chat, asked by the session chairs, and answered by the speakers.
In addition, in the first POM, we decided to use a single online interface for both watching the speakers and entering questions."
112,"The format of POM was deliberately chosen to be very similar to that of conventional conferences.
POM was organised in less than 3 months, and most of the advertisement was done through Twitter, which is the most common platform for academic interaction.
Thus, we encouraged the creation and registration of local viewing groups at various institutions, which we called ‘POM-Hubs’.
We anticipated that a POM-Hub would be hosted in a conference room or auditorium at an institute or university, where POM participants could gather into a sociable, in-person event.
The POM organizers, mostly at their own local hubs, kept in touch via Slack.
We would like to emphasize some of the innovations of POM as compared to in-person conferences and existing online events such as webinars.
For some scientists around the world, particularly students, POM was a truly unique opportunity to experience an academic meeting."
113,"Such methods often have an assumption about the structure of the network, such as global average pooling before the softmax layer.
W and U are the weight matrices adjusted during learning along with b, which is the bias.
This corresponds to sampling from infinite ensembles of neural networks.
This corresponds to sampling nodes, which is equivalent to sampling from ensembles of neural networks [52].
The stochastic optimization and random initialization ensure that the trained networks are sufficiently independent.
This assumption is based on the idea that a single-layer neural network tends to converge to a Gaussian process in the limit of an infinite number of hidden units [74].
In the internal process, backpropagation is performed to obtain the optimal weights.
The initial conditions and parameters are randomly sampled at each iteration n over predefined intervals called bundles [19], [21], so that the network learns an entire family of solutions."
114,"However, the cross-over between China and the United States cannot be misinterpreted or overinterpreted.
It should be noted that some of the data needs to be processed using the TableBuilder: https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/tablebuilder.
Hence, our respondents do not cover the majority of other countries.
This cultural characteristic cannot be easily captured with data sources such as Google Books or search data.
Rather, such impact may only become visible in national data in subsequent generations.
Particularly, the data on mainland China is of poor quality, and cannot be used in this study.
Knowledge of these quantities may however not be largely accessible across different regions of the world.
Some countries still do not share all the data collected.
1, we analysed the data records by organisation, not by nation.
But surprisingly, this analysis shows that UK is not collaborating with the US and Italy as strongly as with China."
115,"Unfortunately, these data are only available for the whole country rather than particular regions.
These models were trained using data from all China provinces except Hubei (that was used for testing).
There were no counties that were excluded from the dataset as a result of few POIs or lower device counts (see the Section 3.6 in S1 File).
We obtained Chinese data from the Wolfram Data Repository [50], and corrected it as in reference [51].
The data, together with many other relevant datasets from Canada and other countries, can be found here: https://howsmyflattening.ca/#/data.
We turn now to China that provides the data basis for this analysis.
Recall that Mainland China is not included in the dataset."
116,"An analyser could fulfil several roles: it could serve to map existing efforts and identify gaps across various governments.
Where an analyser might identify gaps in the technical landscape, a developer would structure policy proposals to close the gaps.
A developer provides either directly actionable and implementable measures and advice, or formulates new policy solutions to existing issues.
The development process itself might include multiple steps, for example from the identification of a pressing policy issue to the proposed solution.
Of course, it is important that in either case the developer would be in a position such that its work will be actioned or meaningfully acted upon once proposed.
To ensure flexibility and a sufficient degree of future orientedness, it might serve the developer to have a mandate beyond election cycles and independent to political agendas.
The benefits and trade-offs of one big impartial investigator versus multiple nationally located investigators needs to be weighed carefully."
117,"Table 3 illustrates the hourly work engagement of the ten states.
Georgia and Maryland demonstrate relatively higher average work engagements (>0.15).
Table 4 shows the daily work engagement in the first week after stay-at-home orders were announced.
The average daily patterns for each state is very similar to the hourly ones.
For example, both the daily and hourly average engagements in California and New York were negative.
6, hourly and daily work engagement patterns of the same state are very similar along the nine weeks.
During this period, both hourly and daily work engagements of the same state also fluctuate considerably.
As Table 5, Table 6 show, averaged hourly and daily work engagement of the nine states except Alaska are positive.
People demonstrate much higher work engagement in the afternoon than in the morning (see the last second row in Table 5).
Their different hourly patterns during 8:00 to 17:00 inspire us to propose approaches to measure work engagement."
118,"And yet most theoretical analysis of this effect has assumed bidirectional social interactions, even though actual human interactions are often unidirectional.
Friend controls may be quite similar to the cases, which is an intended benefit of matching.
119–120 in Ref 19), for example, popular persons and extroverts are more often mentioned as friends.
This generates two internally correlated, but externally independent friend groups.
It elegantly captures phenomena associated with group dynamics such as peer pressure.
In other words, we have a random selection of partners to form groups.
Empirically, clustering quantifies the effect commonly known as “a friend of a friend is also likely to be my friend”.
Empirically, clustering quantifies the effect commonly known as “a friend of a friend is also likely to be my friend”.
In this model, each individual completely changes the set of his/her social connections at some timescale τs."
119,"When designing predictive models for healthcare, or any other high-stakes decisions, the explainability of the model is a key part of the solution.
For predictive models, two general approaches to explainability are either by using classes of interpretable-by-design models or using post-hoc explanations.
Despite the obvious advantages of interpretable-by-design models, their construction requires more domain knowledge linked to the construction of interpretable features.
Thus, the developer can focus on model performance by pouring large volumes of data into a neural network and then deal with model explanations afterwards.
There are many model-agnostic interpretation methods which do not rely on model architecture and can be easily used for explanations, such as: LIME, or Anchors.
Several prominent explainability methods for deep models have been used to provide input-dependent explanations using visual explanations and salient regions.
Model-based and post-hoc interpretability are the two most common types of interpretation approaches."
120,"Even assuming that an SC provides an accurate diagnosis, lay individuals must still follow triage instructions to achieve the intended benefits of SCs at a population level.
Ensuring that users trust SCs is therefore of paramount importance if SCs are to achieve their intended benefits with regard to reducing the pressures faced by health care systems globally.
The goal of the SC explanation is to generate enough trust in the recipient so that they will follow triage instructions to reduce health system burden [8,10].
This is in contrast to using an SC where an individual is likely to use it infrequently, that is, when they have a medical need.
Millions of people around the world today are being encouraged to use SCs as a first port of call when seeking nonemergency medical care.
This additional demand could overburden health care systems and fail to deliver the promoted benefits of using SCs.
The choice between SMF and BP must thus be based on the trade-off between simplicity and privacy vs. efficacy."
121,"These can in turn be used to estimate epidemic parameters such as transmissibility, basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number, incidence, prevalence and cumulative incidence.
The low R0 in combination with public health practices allowed for its spread to be contained (8).
For example, one of the best known uses of R0 is in determining the critical coverage of immunization required to eradicate a disease in a randomly mixing population.
To estimate the basic reproduction number of endemic diseases, different approaches are taken.
We estimated the time-dependent basic reproduction numbers, [Formula: see text] , and the fractions of infected but unaffected populations, to offer insights into containment and vaccine strategies in African countries.
We estimated the basic reproduction numbers by simultaneous fits of the SIDARTHE model to the data of infected, recovered and dead cases."
122,"Figure
2 illustrates the degree to which the case count for Hubei Province and the
aggregated case count for all other provinces is captured by the SIR-X model as defined by
Eqs.
We present model analyses for all affected Chinese provinces
in the SM (c.f.
The model reproduces the empirical case counts in all provinces well for plausible
parameter values.
Figs 5 and 6 display the case count profiles and posterior mean estimates for a selection of counties around the state, for model 3.
The time‐varying ℛ0,e for each Colorado county is displayed in Figure 5.
The dynamics of some counties are slightly different, such as additional peaks in ℛ0,e in early Fall 2020."
123,"The top‐cities and population‐based baselines, by relying on demographic information exclusively, fail account for disparities in the severity of the across the country.
Similar to the Chicago case study, the first instance problem for NYC considers Race, and the second instance consider Age as the sensitive attribute.
8 present the results for the top 15 populated regions in the New York City for racial and age instance problems.
10 show the results for the top 15 populated regions in the Baltimore City for racial and age instance problems.
The results are obtained based on the aforementioned racial group instance problem for the city of Chicago.
We designed three instance problems for each city based on different demographic attributes, race, age, and gender."
124,"This study ascertains whether explanations provided by a symptom checker affect explanatory trust among laypeople (N=750) and whether this trust is impacted by their existing knowledge of disease.
For loadings of trust by disease, see Table 3, and for loadings of trust by explanation type, see Table 4.
Variances in trust sentiment by explanation type were examined by performing multivariate ANOVAs (MANOVAs) on each disease subset.
As exploratory factor analysis generated different components per disease, the participants seemed to have differing conceptualizations of trust.
This section builds on the previous finding that the disease being explained is a key factor in determining trust in explanation.
Our results suggest that the disease being explained is a primary factor in determining trust in subsequent explanation (RQ 2)."
125,"This platform reduced economic impact greatly, through successful containment that avoided social distancing measures.
Additionally, looking at the economic and social aspects, measures based on isolation are not sustainable in the long run.
In the absence of strong social protection and insurance, the cost imposed by social and economic distancing may be large in terms of immediate deprivation and hunger.
It is important to emphasize that social distancing policies are a form of risk reduction.
Continuing to use the USA as the benchmark for high-income countries, we see that the value of social distancing remains significantly higher in higher-income countries.
Beyond the level shift when evaluating the value of social distancing policies in high- and low- income countries, our conclusion about the relative value of these interventions remains the same.
Third, the economic opportunity cost of social distancing is larger in lower-income countries and therefore the VSL is lower.
Additionally, introduced social distancing measures aimed at the protection of the
susceptible population, induced by behavioral changes as well as the partial shutdown of
public life (17)."
126,"The maximum value was chosen to be 2.5 because realistically, most countries enforce social distancing up to 2 metres.
Hence this model assumes 1.5 metres of social distancing and 99% mask usage from day 0.
Hence, this is modelled by increasing the social distancing metres to 0.5, also on the 7th day.
The government then began strictly enforcing 1 metre of social distancing [64], which is modelled by increasing the social distancing metres to 1 on the 10th day.
To model this in the simulation, the social distancing metres was increased to 2.
This is modelled by decreasing the social distancing metres to 1.5 from day 28.
that higher compliance to social distancing when I is small could lead to much smaller R(∞)."
127,"This work is concerned with the UK labour market and adds to the body of knowledge about how lockdown policy affected job vacancies in that country.
There is a drastic drop in the number of adverts for these schemes, with a very slow recovery in the weeks after lockdown.
As might have been expected during a public health emergency, the number of ads for nurses increased somewhat during lockdown and in the weeks after.
However, at the beginning of lockdown the number of adverts for drivers decreased significantly, in line with trends in other sectors.
The type of breaks taken during work were categorized as: breaks taken freely, fixed breaks with time shift, and fixed breaks without time shift.
Fixed breaks without time shift mean that all workers have their breaks at the same time.
Fixed breaks with time shift mean that there is a break pattern where different working groups, departments or divisions have different time windows for their break."
128,"We presume this increase is due to increased testing ability and contact tracing efforts made in all countries.
While testing levels of 40% or above are achievable,[

69

] as they are comparable with the estimates for the late summer 2020 in France[

65

] they are still challenging to attain.
Several countries are under-testing their population, making the number of reported cases below reality.
Even for the countries that are doing massive testing, there are often delays between the real occurrences and notification.
Finally, we want to emphasize, that the historic example cases discussed here certainly do not completely reflect the reality of testing in Austria in 2020.
Not only did early cases spread throughout Europe and the US before testing programs had been established, but testing protocols were far from uniform across the year and between countries.
Indeed, several countries changed their testing protocols on various occasions, including within the same wave [64], [65], [66].
A large value of the ”unaffected population” will demonstrate the lack of testing."
129,"The dataset also displays the population size N according to 2019 World Bank census for each geographical region.
The populations of cities were obtained from the US Census Bureau (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020).
Second, we used methods from multivariate statistics to derive friendship coordinates for the federal districts in Germany.
Particularly we aimed to measure the extent of geographic variability in this relationship and how it was associated with the socio-demographic profile of local population.
The exact steps for creating the population from building information and census data are outlined in Section S3, Supporting Information.
Population Dataset: The uszipcode

Python package provides detailed geographic, demographic, socio-economic, real estate, and education information at the state, city, and even zip code level for different areas within the US.
1, the largest cities in each region were identified using population data made available by the United Nations17."
130,"The analysis targets the impact of the lockdown on consumer card spending in each state, and the rate of spending recovery once state restrictions were lifted.
Besides the correlation between COVID-19 incidence and consumer card spending, we also discuss the effect of state reopening policies on this spending indicator.
One is the overall change in consumer card spending (relative to January 2020).
The second version of spend(t) is the change in card spending by consumers living at zip codes in the top quartile of median income [20].
We examine in more detail the relationship between policy interventions and consumer card spending, which is illustrated in Fig 2.
Consumer card spending decreases sharply and rebounds gradually in all states examined, regardless the differences in COVID-19 incidence rates observed across the states."
131,"The campaign aimed to collect fact-checked information from regions that had already suffered from the infodemic and spread them to other regions where the infodemic was at its infancy.
At the same time, there is a noticeable variance in the infodemic’s reach across continents.
Another important finding of this study is that economically disadvantaged countries are exposed more to the infodemic than richer countries.
Most importantly, our findings indicate that the infodemic could disproportionately hit economically disadvantaged countries the hardest.
We also highlighted the importance of local efforts in fighting the infodemic as claims might be constrained to specific regions.
Additionally, our study indicates that economically vulnerable countries are more susceptible to infodemic."
132,"Of the patients admitted to hospital, 35 769 (98.7%) were included in the analysis; the remaining 464 (1.3%) patients were in single individual strata and therefore uninformative.
Hence, a total of 655 323 (78.1%) patients were informative for the base model.
The x-axis represents the latitude–longitude coordinate, while the y-axis shows its number of patients.
The height of each bar represents the number of patients in that month.
We marked the number of patients and their percentage (%) at the top of the bar.

133,"In other words, all provinces are used to predict the sales in a given province without including that province.
Specifically, the observed response for province p is abnormal if either case is true:
The choice of a smaller value of t will lead to a larger number of provinces being predicted to be abnormal.
As indicated, to quantify the anomalies in the Spanish provinces, we use the upper anomaly ratio (UAR) and the lower anomaly ratio (LAR).
Six provinces also stand out in the temporal evolution of the UAR in the Spanish territory.
In addition, regarding the UAR, the anomalies in the provinces with sales above those estimated reach values of 190%.
Furthermore, in Spain, the provinces with sales volumes above the expected values have higher ratios than those in which sales are below the expected values."
134,"Definition 1MonomialA function f(x) is called a monomial if it has the form f(x)=cx1a1x2a2…xnan,for a1,…,an∈R and c>0.
Definition 2PosynomialA sum of one or more monomials is called a posynomial, that is, a function of the form f(x)=∑i=1kcix1ai,1x2ai,2…xnai,n.
Since posynomials admit negative exponents but do not admit negative coefficients they are not necessarily polynomials, and vice versa.
We remark that posynomials are closed under addition, multiplication, and positive scalar multiplication.
This result extends trivially to the product of an arbitrary number of matrices with posynomial entries.
A careful application of Hölder’s inequality shows that posynomials are convex in log-scale."
135,"The number of vacancies remained low throughout lockdown and in the weeks after.
This unexpected behaviour shows that companies reacted to lockdown by reducing costs, rather than hiring in anticipation of increased demand.
There is a suggestion that job vacancies increased after the local lockdown lifted.
The effect on the job market should be considered when extending or relaxing lockdown rules and especially in relation to extending or ending furlough and other compensation schemes.
Perhaps, the most important one being the second lockdown that came into force on 5 November 2020, ending on 2 December 2020.
It is interesting that the demand in March experienced a relatively important decrease although the lockdown started on 23 March 2020.
The second lockdown ended on 2nd December, and the average hire time in December became similar to its corresponding counterfactual."
136,"In addition, the hidden pool receives a mobility-induced influx Φt of new infections.
Cases are removed from the hidden pool (i) when detected by TTI and put into the quarantined pool IQ or (ii) due to recovery or death.
The subsequent infections remain quarantined, thus entering the EQ pool and, afterward, the IQ pool.
The remaining fraction of produced infections, ϵ, are missed and act as an influx to the hidden pools (EH).
Here, symptomatic, infectious individuals are transferred from the hidden to the traced pool at rate λs.
These contacts, if tested positive, are then transferred from the hidden to the quarantined infectious pools (IH → IQ) with an average delay of τ = 2 days.
The traced individuals are removed from either the exposed hidden pool EH or from the infectious hidden pool IH after a delay of τ days after testing.
This, however, only holds for the asymptomatic hidden infectious pool."
137,"However, school reopening can contribute to statistically significant increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community transmission is relatively high.
Many of the challenges inherent in quantifying the impact of closure remain when policy-makers subsequently turn to the reopening of schools.
For school reopening, we track the growth rate in cases over the intervention timeline and search for correlations between these interventions and changes in the growth rate.
Our aim here is to assess if there is any correlation between changes in the growth rate, and the timing of school reopening.
Owing to differing policies across German states, the dates of school reopening and the ages of students returning were variable.
Our model provides options to simulate school closure, lockdown, and three reopening phases, 1, 2, and 3."
138,"We investigate the effect of school closure and subsequent reopening on the transmission of COVID-19, by considering Denmark, Norway, Sweden and German states as case studies.
In countries where community transmission is generally low, such as Denmark or Norway, a large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible.
We hope these results can serve as a series of lessons learned from nations that have already reopened schools.
Despite no official nation wide closing of primary or secondary schools in Sweden, there were local closures in response to outbreaks within the community.
Policy-makers should carefully consider their nations’ respective capacities and associated effectiveness of infection management before considering a partial or full reopening of schools.
The only differences in this vaccination study were the absence of school closures and any form of lockdown.
In this context, the study also investigated the consequences of leaving schools and non‐essential businesses open throughout the first wave of the epidemic upon the availability of a vaccine."
139,"In addition to interventions designated to curb local transmissions, travel restrictions were put in place to reduce the circulation of the virus between cities and to/from different countries.
Then, at the end of the first infection wave, many authorities, pressed with a need to restart economies and provide essential transportation, eased restrictions and cautiously resumed public transport.
[7] the authors studied the role of travel restrictions in halting pandemics by using short-range mobility data and explored alternative scenarios by assessing the potential impact of mobility restrictions.
Such massive travel restrictions ultimately lead to successful control of COVID-19, saving the country from a huge health crisis.
In this work, we use a data-driven approach to estimate the effectiveness of such massive travel restrictions in the mitigation of disease impact.
Our work shows that highly coordinated massive travel restrictions are central to effective mitigation and control of COVID-19 outbreaks in China."
140,"However, the suppression at this stage comes at a high cost and requires an extended lockdown to regain control.
In fact, the aim of the lockdown is to reduce the contact rate.
A similar study conducted during the lockdown in the UK report consistent, though smaller, reduction contacts (a factor 4) [27].
We show that a lockdown can reestablish control and that recurring lockdowns are not necessary given sustained, moderate contact reduction.
4E), and (iii) the frequency at which lockdowns have to reoccur—should the after-lockdown contact reduction not be enough to grant metastability—is lower (Fig.
Until then, repeated lockdowns will remain necessary if contact reductions outside of lockdown are insufficient (see discussion in the preceding section)."
141,"These initial cases can be in different testing stages and undergo treatment.
Early screening allows segregation of patients and early treatment intervention.
Early diagnosis would open the door to early-stage interventions, most likely to be effective.
5) There should be a screening test or examination for the condition.
If treatment is more effective during the preclinical stage of disease, as is the case for most conditions, screening for disease during the detectable pre-clinical phase offers an advantage [4].
In this scenario, early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system.
However, the criteria for conducting tests (diagnosis) on potential patients may not be uniform in different prefectures; some patients may exhibit weak symptoms.
Testing of symptomatic cases started right away before the first case was identified, especially those coming from outside [30]."
142,"This baseline corresponds to a state‐level approach based on epidemiological information alone.
Carefully crafted, and high-resolution, longitudinal epidemiological studies may be a way forward in this regard.
However, some clinical data directly measure the quantity of epidemiological interest.
Previously, several methodological approaches have evolved to capture the influence of explanatory variables on the response variables in the epidemiological study (Bashir et al., 2020).
The evidence in favour of different epidemiological models can also be assessed, in the light of data.
Despite this, its simplicity and the insights it offers on how key epidemiological variables affect individuals are among its main strengths."
143,"The relationship between a screening tests’ positive predictive value, ρ, and its target prevalence, ϕ, is proportional—though not linear in all but a special case.
Screening is defined as the presumptive identification of unrecognised disease in asymptomatic individuals by means of tests, examinations or procedures [1].
In 1968, the World Health Organization (WHO) published guidelines on the principles and practice of screening for disease, which are often referred to as the Wilson–Jungner criteria [3].
When conducting a screening test, 4 different parameters help to determine its overall ability to correctly identify individuals with the disease in question [5].
All screening parameters are fundamental to the understanding of the value of screening tests, their limitations, and the concepts thus far described in this work.
The curvilinear relationship between a screening test’s positive predictive value and its target disease prevalence is proportional.
The prevalence threshold can help contextualize the validity of a screening test in real time, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics and epidemiology of specific conditions."
144,"In case of negative test (QS) the individual is reverted to susceptible.
Test-negative case–control studies4–9 are based on persons who undergo testing because they present with signs and symptoms of a particular disease.
This strategy leads to the case–control comparisons represented in Figure 1: test-positives with their accompanying persons (CC-POS comparison), and test-negatives with their accompanying persons (CC-NEG comparison).
We identify a positive testing bias b>0 with an overrepresentation of previously or currently infected individuals in the study population.
Conversely, a negative testing bias b<0 corresponds to an overrepresentation of susceptible and/or non-infectious individuals in the study population.
Return to work policies required a negative test in 76% of centers."
145,"Among many symptoms, cough, fever and tiredness are the most common.
Present symptoms are motor or sensitive, including pain and limb numbness, and can lead to traumatic injuries, infections and metabolic disorders [9].
Respiratory symptoms included dry cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, sore throat, and chest pain or pressure.
The test-negatives will have another reason for their similar signs and symptoms; most likely they will have another viral respiratory infection.

Other symptoms include shortness of breath, joint pain, muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and loss of smell or taste [4].
Patients have a variety of symptoms during the illness, including shortness of breath, fever, dry cough, and chronic fatigue."
146,"The cost is given the weight 1−α and the total trip duration, i.e., the total travel and waiting times, is given the weight α.
If the request is at the start of the trip, then the starting time of the trip is used as the request time.
If this is not the case, the request time is obtained by following the path.
Every shuttle route is associated with a starting time and an ending time.
The starting time is the latest request time among the passengers on the route, which ensures that the route can only be started when all passengers are ready.
The ending time follows from adding the route duration to the starting time.
Requests are only passed on as they arrive in real time, to prevent unrealistic anticipation.
The cost cr of route r is the sum of the waiting times before pickup.
The cost of not serving request p is given by gp, which increases exponentially based on how long the rider has been waiting."
147,"We did not include data after March 7, 2021, because our model does not include the effects of vaccination and it would be inappropriate to include the data thereafter.
While the studies above offer valuable insights regarding COVID-19 vaccine issues, they have several limitations.
12, is that the leading research organisations on Covid-19 vaccine are not based in the leading country on Covid-19 vaccine - in Fig.
13, we can see that the USA is the overall leader in research on Covid-19 vaccine.
Since we cannot answer these questions from the current data records, we applied computable statistical analysis to look for further insights on the relationships between organisations, countries and Covid-19 vaccine.
16, we can see that despite the current political issues between the USA and China, the scientific research on Covid-19 vaccine is very strong."
148,"Previous publications report that asymptomatic individuals in the I compartment are 2–4 times less likely to get tested than symptomatic individuals [11] but similar estimates are not available for Brazil.
In particular, we hypothesized that each symptomatic agent was tested with probability equal to 80%, while such a probability was reduced to 40% for asymptomatic agents.
Our results also emphasize that detecting pre‐symptomatic and asymptomatic agents is a critical issue.
We considered the percentage of asymptomatic patients to be constant across regions, based on governmental reports [36].
Asymptomatic cases are not reported usually, could be pre-symptomatic or not, and so cannot be observed unless widespread repeated surveys are carried out in the population.
If the disease remains undiagnosed throughout (asymptomatic, weakly symptomatic etc."
149,"The situation is better for riders only using rail: their trips take 25 min on average.
Note that the time to get to the bus stop or rail station is not included in this calculation, which means that the actual trips take longer.
The contribution to the trip duration is τa, since the shuttles are assumed to be available within a short waiting time.
For riders not using rail, the average trip duration remains under 27 min on average.
In terms of performance, the average trip duration is increased by less than a minute.
The lowest speed could correspond to a typical situation encountered at many work places, schools, theater, or bars."
150,"2A illustrates the fit to our analytical solution for the aggregated data of all Spanish Autonomous regions, representing country-level progression.
We have also fitted the model to each Spanish Autonomous region and have obtained analogous overall conclusions.
We project the data to the full population of the country and restrict our analysis to continental Spain only.
Spain shares a border with France and Gibraltar, two countries with which it maintains a price differential by excess and by deficit.
In addition, some recent studies have indicated that distortions are observed around the Spanish borders with France and Gibraltar18,19.
Although the cited study indicates that there are distortions in the provinces bordering France and Gibraltar, it is important to know the magnitude of these distortions.
Our empirical analysis was developed using a panel of data from the Spanish provinces from 2002 to 2017, the year when the latest data on provincial GDP were published.
Furthermore, given its abovementioned characteristics, Spain seems to be a reasonable candidate country in which to quantify anomalies."
151,"A second set of parameters mimics the rates at which I (isolated) and H (hospitalized) individuals develop clinically relevant or life-threatening symptoms.
Therefore, they are assumed to be diagnosed and hospitalized before their death.
It corresponds to people who, after recovering from the disease, were discharged from the hospitals.
Obviously, prior to recovering, they were diagnosed with the disease and hospitalized due to their severe symptoms.
These patients are likely to have had shorter disease durations, because they were already sufficiently unwell or frail to be in hospital.
On the other hand, some individuals develop more serious symptoms and are hospitalized (H) for control."
152,"Here, it is demonstrated that the distribution function can be used to reveal the distinct pattern and characteristics of the viral genomes.
In the group of viruses, each species shows more distinct clustering of parameters, and most of the sequences lie on a straight line of ebolavirus, flavivirus, and influenza A (Fig.
The nearest neighbor approach to classification then assigns the host of the closest virus to the unknown virus.
The collected data consist of  genome sequences or primary protein sequences, denoted , of viruses whose host class, denoted  is known.
We also assume that all viruses replicating inside the same host are identical, thus they can be modeled by a single RNA sequence.
Viruses of two different hosts, however, can be different due to the mutations that happen randomly and independently at each nucleotide."
153,"Some additional differences are due to delayed effects, population age, typical medical conditions of the population, and healthcare system efficiency.
In Brazilian context, believed that the average of 3388 municipalities could have a significant deficit in hospital beds.
In addition, hospitalization rates may vary depending on access to medical resources and the severity of previous diseases [17].
This suggests that hospitalization criteria might have been highly heterogeneous across different countries and may also greatly vary over time.
Hospital‐related transmission rates are calculated by scaling equivalent non‐hospital rates with data from our clinical consultant in Italy.
Healthcare variables that are inputted to the GAs as determinants of generational updates are: hospital performance, death rates, and number of beds.
Crucial factors such as hospital capacity, demographic structure, and economic activities, among others, strongly vary between cities."
154,"There is also an additional data for the diagnosed cases from French retirement homes (EHPAD).
However, the French government database5 and several other international databases6

do not add the diagnosed cases from EHPAD to the cumulative number of diagnosed (confirmed) cases.
That is, the data for the cumulative number of diagnosed cases is considered to be inclusive of the diagnosed cases from EHPAD.
However, in all the above databases, the data on cumulative number of deaths is collected separately from both the hospitals and EHPAD.
The data on the cumulative number of diagnosed cases is considered to be inclusive of the diagnosed cases from the French retirement homes (EHPAD).
Those who died at the hospitals and those who died in the retirement homes (EHPAD) are considered to be distinct.
First, we divided the test set into three groups: patients with predicted mortality probabilities less than 0.05, those between 0.05 and 0.5, and those greater than 0.5."
155,"This could be potentially beneficial in relieving the pressure on the healthcare system so that not to exceed capacity on hospitals.
Hospitals are crowded with the exponentially growing number of patients as available resources are limited.
Therefore, we could not quantify how efficiently our model could lower the burden on the healthcare system.
A similar problem arises when the public administration plans and provides hospitals (beds) in different localities, but the local patients prefer ‘better’ perceived hospitals elsewhere.
These ‘outsider’ patients would then have to choose other suitable hospitals elsewhere.
External (geographic) or internal factors (medical and managerial) lead to shifts in planning and budgeting, but most importantly, reduce confidence in conventional processes.
In some cases, support from other hospitals proves necessary, which exacerbates the planning aspect.
It is clear that using results with state centers (using geographical longitudes and latitudes) is more straightforward and simpler; versus when using locations of hospitals (Figure 4a,b)."
156,"Table B2 in S1 File reports the variance inflation factor for different independent variables used in the baseline model.
The mean variance inflation factor is 2.65 which is relatively low [27].
Most variable are moderately correlated with a variance inflation factor inferior to 5.
The variable with the highest variance inflation factors is school closure (13.89).
We leverage the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) [35], which detects whether an explanatory variable is highly collinear with other variables, resulting in large standard errors for the coefficient estimates.
[23], R. Chicheportiche and I showed how to weld the standard factor model for returns with a factor model for volatilities.
In terms of variance inflation factors (VIFs), the multicollinearity was evaluated."
157,"There is a positive, but somewhat weaker, correlation between the number of people visiting restaurants and transmission.
However, the coefficient for the number of people visiting restaurants is heterogenous across counties (Figure S38).
This must be viewed in light of concurrent adjustment for the proportion of individuals working from home, which is positively correlated with restaurant visits.
In California and Colorado, the coefficient was not meaningfully different from zero (Figure S38) but restaurant mobility was positively correlated with transmission (Figure 7).
Restaurant mobility was also positively correlated with transmission in New York, where the coefficient was negative.
The models for Florida, Georgia, and Texas also yielded negative posterior means for the coefficients of restaurant mobility.
In these two states, more people working from home was positively correlated with transmission and more people visiting restaurants was negatively correlated with transmission (Figure 7)."
158,"This policy is arguably impractical, difficult to enforce and harmful to its citizens’ psychological health, as well as to the national economy.
However, the interest of health on the one hand and society and economy on the other hand are not always contradictory.
However, the apparent trade-off between public health interest and freedom is not always linear and straightforward.
Nonetheless, we would expect a saturation of the public health system.
As it is established, measuring the health of economy is a long-lasting science; however, only recently, the economy of health is a gaining traction and is a rising research area.
Limiting the strain on health systems has been another constant concern of policy makers.
All public health policy responses to these demands should thus be well considered."
159,"In general, quantitative advantage does not equal quality or impact advantage.
Therefore, it is more suitable to compare like with like: compare apples to apples rather than to oranges.
Unfortunately, it is hard to perform a complete apples‐to‐apples comparison.
Additionally, it is unclear how additional dimensions impact the statistical properties of the data and interpretability of the results.
For this reason, it is rather difficult to make a reliable comparison.
We do not consider in the comparison possible acronyms, i.e.
Namely, the difference can be statistically significant, but too small to be meaningful.
There are different opinions on how to evaluate these measures."
160,"It is crucial to rapidly identify and characterize new variants of concern such that public health measures can be adapted to emerging threats.
This will be crucial for timely global public health responses.
We also assume it as a proxy for health indicators and healthcare infrastructure.
The findings and hypotheses discussed above inform scholars and policymakers on the response to future public health crises.
A need for an effective public health response to the collapse of the global trade is elucidated in [6].
Moreover, the framework presented in this paper could be applied broadly to various epidemiological or economic crises."
161,"The unaffected fractions of the populations studied vary between [Formula: see text] % of the recovered cases.
The modeling of the recovered population contains the unaffected population; however, as discussed later in Sections 4 and 5, the collected data do not account for the unaffected categories.
Until March 29, 2020, in terms of the SIDARTHE model, the unaffected and recovered fraction of population were comparable as seen in Fig.
An estimate of the unaffected fraction of the Kenyan population is shown in bottom-right plot of Fig.
The modeling, validation and the unaffected fraction of the Togolese population are shown in Fig..
The validation of the modeling for Zambia, and the unaffected fraction of the Zambian population are shown in right plots of Fig."
162,"As in Case A, strain 2 remains under control for the entire horizon.
The increased control levels result in the near extinction of both strains after about 125 days.
As before, strain 2 remains controlled over the entire horizon.
As depicted in Fig 11, this results in a maximum level of control until both strains are virtually extinguished.
We found that, when optimal control is activate just after the second strain emerges, it will stabilise the first strain while preventing an outbreak of the second strain.
In reality, highly transmissible strains tend to increase the threshold value, possibly keeping this goal out of reach."
163,"However, mathematical and computational tools can be used to extract part of this information from the available data, like some hidden age-related characteristics.
The left plot shows our sample’s age distribution from Brazilian survey respondents alongside the true Brazilian population’s age distribution.
The age distribution in our sample reflects that of the Lombardy population (Supplementary Figure S1).
In Figure 4 we show the distribution of age groups in each population across countries that are classified as either high or low income.
Each point represents the fraction of the population within that age range in a country.
While the population structure in higher-income countries is more evenly distributed across the entire age range, the population in lower-income countries is heavily skewed younger.
As evidenced in Figure 2c,d, we closely match the distribution of employed family members and the overall age distribution, accurately resolving several age groups.
This is consistent with regional age demographics in England and Wales."
164,"That is determined through the application of standardized mortality ratios and the population of geographical areas.
Morbidity and mortality statistics have been updated every day in each prefecture in Japan, which provides a good opportunity for local studies.
The effect of ambient temperature on the mortality was discussed in Wuhan [8].
A statistical study was conducted to analyze the correlation of different factors on both mortality and morbidity rates.
In this subsection, the morbidity/mortality rates are estimated in terms of different factors.
The effect of ambient conditions on the morbidity and mortality rates was shown to be modest over multiple prefecture studies.
The morbidity and mortality rates were roughly derived via multivariate analysis."
165,"When at least one subpopulation is in the strict measures phase, we introduce travel restrictions by reducing the spatial transition rate to 5% of the original value, i.e.
While computationally feasible, the main limitation nowadays is represented by the availability of mixing data and travel behavior for a large set of countries, given a global level objective.
For example, the geographical structure of Sierra Leone constrains the number of possible trips over 300 km.
We ensured that our aggregation methodology does not alter the overall distributions of travel time, travel distance, and the fraction of travels.
[27], we are not interested in the zone where people live, but in capturing the trip-chaining characteristics of overall travels.
We observe, in fact, that using just 40% of the travels is enough to capture the overall mobility patterns."
166,"[31] assert that decreases in mobility may have come from perceived risk and other factors such as media coverage, and Marzouki et al.
When dropping the mobility variable from the analysis, however, we observed no measurable decrease in explained variation.
Studying the effects of cross-region mobility were not at the main focus of this study, but the sensitivity analysis that we performed for the overall mobility factor has interesting implications.
Decreases in mobility were associated with substantial reductions in case growth two to four weeks later.
For example, a 10% reduction in mobility was associated with a 17.5% reduction in case growth two weeks later.
Decreases in mobility were associated with substantial reductions in case growth 2–4 weeks later.
These estimates of timing and magnitude of the impacts of changes in mobility on case growth are consistent with previous reports7–11,13–18.
Such recovery in mobility concerns as large parts of the country are still in their early stages of reopening, highlighting the challenges of curbing overall mobility in the long run."
167,"Minor modifications allow this approach to keep its effectiveness even in the presence of active vaccination campaigns.
In comparison, the benchmarks cannot reach the same impact of vaccinations.
In the last case (with a daily budget of 500 000 vaccines), the proposed solution is dominated by the re‐optimized solution, but remains within 2% of the new optimum.
5 we theoretically compare our strategy of dynamic vaccination with a very effective strategy, targeted vaccination [62], and with another that usually performs poorly, random vaccination [63].
To summarize, we demonstrate that, on top of a multiplex network structure, dynamic vaccination strategy is much more efficient than random immunization.
Our analysis reveals that designing efficient vaccination strategies at a level of a country is highly nontrivial.
Vaccination strategy is indeed an important issue, particularly when vaccines cannot be sufficiently supplied to the majority of population."

] The peak benefits for all three vaccine types last for an 8‐month period following recent studies on the humoral and cellular immune responses.
[

] It cannot be excluded that an additional dose may only selectively boost the efficacy for individuals who are immunocompromised or whose initial vaccination had low efficacy.
We can either incorporate another state (say vaccinated V) or alternatively consolidate vaccinated with the recovered state, with slow temporal relaxation time (per the diminishing protection that a vaccine offers).
We assume that full vaccination provides a high level of protection against severe illness and death, as confirmed not only by trial data [24] but also by real-world application [25,26].
We have concentrated on the fact that vaccination basically eliminates the risk of death [43].
It takes into account those that have received a vaccine shot but are still not fully immunized by it."
169,"This is due to the presence of a smaller number of recovered persons who, unlike vaccinated people, maintain immunity.
One special case that one has to consider is when individuals acquire the virus in the time frame between being vaccinated and developing an adequate antibody level.
Once an individual receive a vaccine, it can no longer acquire the disease and becomes immunized.
This is due to the fact that the virulence of the disease is not strong enough to overcome the vaccination.
However if after being vaccinated he catch the disease he becomes completely against the vaccination.
Furthermore, vaccinated individuals need some time to develop a proper immune response after receiving the vaccine (57), in which they can still get infected.
Vaccinating is a safe way to transfer people from the Susceptible to the Removed compartment bypassing the Infectious one thus reducing the likelihood of an outbreak."
170,"Making binary decisions is a common data analytical task in scientific research and industrial applications.
Living in a big data era, how can we make rational binary decisions from massive data?
The second step is to outline the binary decisions to be made from the data.
We then assume that they are valid from the context of our work.
Thus, a lack of sufficient data for ML‐approaches will be a challenge.
Then, to produce a credible and valid result, we use some criteria to screen qualified paper records."
171,"Specifically, each unit of the framework can be tested separately, and the algorithms in different parts of the framework can be modified to achieve optimal overall performance.
The framework comprises three parts: preprocessing, deep learning-based modeling, and postprocessing.
A partial matching protocol for applying constraints was also used to improve process accuracy.
All tasks and functions that we identified are classified under these three roles in the results.
The third area of concern is the evaluation, interpretation, and assessment of the results of algorithm decision support, automated pattern matching, or other automation technology.
These and many other factors have to be taken into account when evaluating an algorithmic support system."
172,"The actants are combined into supernodes consisting of subnodes that represent the context dependent relationships of that actant.
Then we define a supernode as a context consisting of all the argument phrases that have a limited but unique and highly-correlated subset of the entities/concepts as substrings.
Similarly, we find {Pizza, CometPizza, Ping, Pong} as the seed words for another supernode.
Thus a supernode defines a general context, which can be further divided into subactants or subnodes as described below.
The subnodes and supernodes play different roles with varying importance.
Similarly, assignment of supernodes to particular domains can lead to ambiguities.
Currently, some hand labeling of supernodes and relationships for clarity in visualizations is inevitable.
This process provides us with a ranked list of candidate entities used to seed the discovery of subnodes and supernodes, and a series of inter-actant relationships (Table 1)."
173,"For low‐to‐moderate testing efficacy, vaccination rates below 0.5% consistently lead to a case and death toll comparable with those experienced during the first wave.
People with previous experience with non-mandatory vaccines also report higher vaccine acceptance (M = 0.171, 95% CI 0.157 − 0.185), whereas general past vaccination has no statistically significant effect.
Modelling suggests that a vaccine with partial efficacy may have a significant impact and cost-effectiveness with maximal gains achieved with the earlier introduction [1].
Additionally, vaccine uptake is bounded because some vulnerable groups cannot be vaccinated because of health-related reasons.
8) percentage points higher share of available vaccine doses than the baseline strategy for Reff = 1.25 (resp.
The introduction of the vaccine in the U.S. reduced the incidence by 98 percent."
174,"2C, we see the bigram “fake news” roiling across social media and news outlets, reflecting the state of political discourse in 2020.
Lazer et al propose that fake news be understood as “fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent” [102].
The term fake news—defined as deliberately falsified news—has proliferated since the 2016 U.S. election [1–7].
LIAR contains fake news from the PolitiFact collection, including short statements, in the form of press releases, TV news, etc.
For example, recent work proposes a large-scale, multi-modal data set NewsBag([44]), containing 200,000 real news and 15,000 fake news.
The real news comes from The Wall Street Journal, and the fake news comes from The Onion.
[32] believe that some fake news is maliciously modified or distorted in the process of multiple dissemination of real news."
175,"As more than 99% of the tweets containing social distancing keywords are encouraging social distancing, we do not use a sentiment analysis algorithm to derive the polarity of each message.
For example, TextBlob detects “excellent” as positive and “not excellent” as negative.
We used the subjectivity threshold to filter out objective tweets, and used the polarity threshold to determine the sentiment.
The negatively classified post topics contained additional keywords such as government, state, science, employee, risks, and several expletives.
Though a human can see the sarcastic intent of such a post, TextBlob rated this post as negative and highly subjective.
Moreover, TextBlob usually exhibits modest returns inaccuracy (50-70 percent), and there may be room for improvement.
We note that the framework features multi-label classification which has multiple outcomes at once, i.e the tweet can be optimistic and joking at the same time.
Fig 9 provides a visualisation of the distribution of tweets with number of combination sentiments."
176,"Our results demonstrate that fact-checks do not spread at the same rate as the rumors themselves.
Given that we opted to choose prevalent rumors on social media, we highlight that only less than half of the people seeing the corresponding fact-checked information is quite alarming.
Swedish and Finnish people seem the least susceptible to the infodemic, with a mere 7.4% of respondents reporting that rumors are believable.
Preparing reactive fact-checks alone might not be enough if their spreading potential is smaller than that of rumors and if falsehoods are considered believable.
Facebook users could also be more susceptible to being exposed to rumors, as false information is rapidly disseminated online.
We defended a proactive stance in disseminating accurate information and flagging suspicious content before rumors are widely spread and believed.
Besides disease spreading, our framework is applicable to rumour or information spreading."
177,"First, for the first time, this paper identifies more algorithms mentioned in papers in a specific field, not only those with pseudocode or detailed descriptions (Tuarob et al., 2016).
Although algorithms of this type may be highly specific, they may not be suitable as comprehensive tools.
The algorithm in steps is provided in the supplementary material for this work.
Our implementation of the above algorithm, available at github.com/pholme/tsir/, uses a mix of C and Python.
Detailed Algorithm: Here, we present the detailed procedure for the proposed model.
A high-level overview of the algorithm is presented here, and a more detailed description is provided by Riley et al.
The details of the algorithm are presented in Appendix B.
More detailed descriptions of the Google matrix based algorithms and the related numerical methods can be found in [25,26,28,30,31].
Suitability and details on the algorithm are further discussed in (59)."
178,"By stopping at nodes with high in-degrees, we can capture how likely a node from one polarity decile receives highly endorsed and well-established information from another polarity decile.
The probability is conditional on the walks ending in any partition to control for varying distribution of high-degree vertices in each polarity decile.
We initiated the random walks 10,000 times randomly in each polarity decile for a maximum walk length of 10.
For both networks, the RWC scores were higher along the diagonal, indicating that random walks most likely terminate close to where they originated.
Any walk in the retweet network that originates in polarity deciles 9 and 10 will terminate in polarity deciles 8 to 10 about 80% of the time.
In contrast, walks that started in deciles 1 to 7 had a near equal, but overall much smaller, probability of landing in deciles 1 to 7."
179,"In the period of machine learning, the important role of machine learning algorithms in ACL papers was revealed.
Between 1997 and 2001, syntactic analysis algorithms and machine learning algorithms took up more than half of the position in turn, and CFG still often appeared in the first place.
The context-free grammar represents an algorithm for which the influence increase first and then decrease.
Before 1996, grammar was more influential than machine learning algorithms.
Therefore, no matter what it analyzes, the influence of syntactic analysis algorithms is gradually being replaced by machine learning algorithms.
According to the previous research results, although the comprehensive influence of the grammar is relatively high, its overall influence shows a downward trend.
Therefore, the influence of machine learning algorithms increased from 1990 to 2000, while the influence of grammars in the field of NLP began to decrease year by year.
Thus, in our results, the influence of grammar is gradually replaced by the influence of machine learning algorithms."
180,"None has used longitudinal social media data to investigate the temporal relationship between misinformation and factual information quantitatively.
Considering the existing research gaps and the importance of studying social media misinformation combatting strategies, this manuscript has two primary questions.
In the contemporary world with social media, misinformation and disinformation can be rapidly disseminated to millions of people [1, 2].
Since social media users frequently discuss news in online peer networks [6,7,19], there is an urgent need to understand whether social influence exacerbates the spread of misinformation.
Yet, prior work on misinformation relies primarily on observational data that is limited in isolating the causal effects of peer-to-peer communication on the public’s capacity to evaluate news veracity [14,16–18].
In popular applications of crowdsourcing [18] in misinformation detection [1–7], communication among human coders is frequently assumed to spread inaccurate judgments.
Meanwhile, misinformation spread by human actors online already cascades throughout social network echo chambers at an alarming rate [40]."
181,"The same idea can be used in deciding which rumors to debunk first.
[11]pointed out that images are more influential than texts and often appear in rumors.
Studies have pointed out that rumors and non-rumors are significantly different in the propagation structure ([40]).
Figure 4 shows the comparison of the dissemination structure of non-rumors and rumors.
The latest research shows that the dissemination structure of rumors and true information is different ([40]).
Since this method focuses too much on the content itself, it cannot guarantee the outbreak of new rumors in the new crown era.
The model can more reasonably determine the rumor’s verdict and embed the evidence sentence into the learned statement.
[121] established a dissemination model to study the mechanism of dispelling rumors through the dissemination dynamics of 8 kinds of rumors."
182,"Therefore, σ−1 and γ−1 correspond to the mean incubation time and the mean recovery time, respectively.
The second outflow from the I compartment consists of those people who are not diagnosed and recover naturally with an average recovery period of 1/γ.
The removed compartment (R) accumulates the diagnosed people who die or recover with a removal rate ρ.
where μ is an Identity Loss Weight and γ is a Counterfactual Loss Weight.
The recovery rate γi of a given age group describes the recovery without the need for critical care.
Also, some studies assumed the average recovery period (i.e 1/ γ) is about 7 days [54, 55], which results in the initial value of γ = 0.13.
In the three-level treatment specification, the number of treatment levels (Gi) is 3; hence we have two γ parameters.
In all compartments, individuals are removed with a rate γ because of recovery or death (see Table 1 for all parameters and Table 2 for all variables of the model)."
183,"The time spent in each infected class (E, IM, IS, H) is considered as a Gamma distribution following [31].
The unidentified recovered compartment (U) accumulates the infected people who recover naturally without being detected with a recovery rate γ.
The macroscopic dynamics present an endemic equilibrium due to the presence of the reinfection rate γR.
Unless mentioned otherwise, we fix the recovery rate γ = 1 such that other rates are defined in units of infectious period (and Δ in units of genetic distance).
The infection lasts 1γ units of time, therefore infected individuals become removed at an overall rate γI.
γ−1 is the mean number of days who is infected spends in the Infectious compartment.
γ−1 is the mean amount of time individuals spend either in the Infectious or Asymptomatic compartments;
The parameter γI(t) denotes the rate of detected infectious individuals becoming noninfectious without being hospitalized."
184,"In a follow-on article, we use these posterior predictives as a basis for stochastic optimal control to determine optimal mitigation strategies for COVID-19 under uncertainty.
An example of the use of optimal control theory to control the present Covid-19 pandemic is presented in Hayhoe et al.
We develop methods for synthesizing control strategies based on the three specific COVID-19 epidemic models with MTL specifications.
In this subsection, we study three models for COVID-19 epidemic [6, 7, 14] and introduce the corresponding models with vaccination control, shield immunity control and quarantine control.
In this subsection, we present the control synthesis methods for the three COVID-19 epidemic models in Section 3.2 with vaccination control, shield immunity control and quarantine control, respectively.
In this paper, we proposed a systematic control synthesis approach for mitigating the COVID-19 epidemic based on three control models with vaccination, shield immunity and quarantine, respectively."
185,"In addition, we can study whether the influence of different algorithms in the same category affect each other.
Using this framework, we classify algorithms and explore the types of algorithms with high influence.
After that, algorithms are classified according to different trends in evolution.
6 demonstrates that a classical algorithm can pass the test of time and prove its value.
We analyzed the different modes of changes in the influence of algorithms in Section 4.3.
Second, we discuss the influence of algorithms from various perspectives.
The existence of breaks would strongly affect the selection of statistical algorithms.
Algorithmic and unsupervised methods have only been qualitatively evaluated on specific systems."
186,"Most of the models were observed to either have less accuracy or a very large number of parameters for the model to be ported to a mobile device.
Some models were customized for mobile devices, but our approach is entirely different from them and outperforms them for a perfect blend of accuracy, parameters, and specificity.
However the app itself allows to adjust a device-dependent single parameter gain; in post processing, a subset of data was corrected for the gain, when known.
Each value reported per producer/model is referred to a single smartphone tested; the variability in the gain response within models was not investigated, except for iOS ones.
Remarkably, it turns out that gain corrections for different iOS models agree within ±1 dB probably thanks to a more standardized manufacturing process.
The ratio of iOS- to Android-based models in the calibrated database differs from the ratio of the whole sample.
The fraction of iOS phones in the calibrated database is 72%."
187,"Studies suggest that false information spreads more broadly than the truth online [3].
An example would be the “official source” term used in the question addressing whether they had seen an official source debunking a specific piece of misinformation.
In fact, there is evidence that those who engage in manufacturing misinformation exploit this research to make their messages more potent.
These results qualitatively match what has been observed in misinformation literature.
While ABMs have been used to model spread of misinformation [16], social media messages [99, 105], and value-laden topics [106], it appears that few have verified outcomes against ground truth.
In the current landscape access to information and misinformation is critical."
188,"After that, a set of research questions was formulated to thoroughly solve the research on the current situation of rumor detection.
Most of these works use users’ replies to statements as propagation information for position detection tasks as the key to completing auxiliary rumor detection tasks.
Finally, combining two features to classify rumors and explore the relevance.
However, research hopes that a rumor detection method can be truly applied in the real world.
The reason is that they were inspired by [126] that they classified rumors into four parts: rumor detection, rumors Tracking, position classification, and accuracy classification.
Therefore, rumor detection algorithms need to be publicly released and reproduced transparently so that their effectiveness can be tested regularly to avoid mislabeling content and users.
Therefore, we believe that the early prediction of rumors as future work is significant for rumors detection."
189,"The Udels query [27] is made up of non-stopwords from the keyword field and the named entities mentioned in the conversational field.
In most cases, these keywords are manually assigned by curators, hence they are expected to be more reliable.
Occasionally, such keywords could be irrelevant, for example, it seems that from all the data records, the keywords Wuhan and China were present in the data records.
This is not deliberate, it's just how the statistical software extracts keywords.
We used the R Studio to design a co-occurrence network of the keywords from the data records.
11 is designed from the keywords found in the text of the data records, and not from the keywords provided by authors, we can expect some irrelevant concepts.
Again, this is simply how the statistical software works, it extracts all keywords that are found to be repeating in different data records.
14), we extracted the keywords from all the data records, and we associated the keywords with countries, and organisations."
190,"This study provides evidence on how science progresses differently during a pandemic from a normal science period.
Through a natural experiment approach, we analyze the impact of the pandemic on scientific production in the life sciences.
We argue that the state of biomedical research was similar in those two years, apart from the effect of the pandemic.
These findings may have implications for understanding the long-term effects of the pandemic on scientific research.
Yet, as we show next, these metrics mask an important way in which the pandemic affected scientists: the rate of new research projects initiated.
It would have been interesting to conduct such analysis at much earlier stages of the pandemic."
191,"Besides politics and media related mentions, the World Health Organization @WHO, the beer brand @corona, and Elon Musk @elonmusk are among the top 40 mentions.
There is also a correspondence between the co-voting and retweeting in the European Parliament, while higher Twitter activity was observed for the right-wing parties [18].
In the case of Brexit, the Leave proponents showed much higher activity and influence on Twitter than the Remain proponents [19].
In the case of the European Parliament, higher Twitter activity was observed for the right-wing parties [18].
In the case of Brexit, the Leave proponents showed much higher activity and influence on Twitter than the Remain proponents [19].
There was little difference in the distribution of retweeters between verified and unverified users."
192,"The PoS comes from the concept that the more stake coins a node has, the higher chance it can fabricate the new block [30].
For example, specific nouns in the fields of politics, entertainment, medical care, etc.
* > matches any type of verb, < IN > matches a preposition or subordinating conjunction, and < DT > matches a determiner.
Also, the “*” symbol after a POS pattern refers to “zero or more occurrences,” while “?” refers to “zero or one occurrence.”
Afterwards, each sentence is further broken down into words or tokens in preparation for POS tagging.
Each token is assigned a POS tag (within the Penn Treebank Tagset) denoting its part of speech in the English language."
193,"The model considers each location in previous feature-map and consider r different boxes.
The box diagram depicts the variation of absolute errors for each model, which reflects the stability of each model.
Analyzing the box-plot, models with lower variation in the errors are indicated by the boxes with a smaller size.
The box diagram depicts the variation of absolute errors for each model, which reflects the stability of each model.
In this context, the dots out of boxes are considered outliers errors, and the black dot inside of the box is the MAE for each model.
Through the box-plot analysis, boxes with lower size indicate models with lower variation in the errors, and the results presented in Table A.1 are corroborated by the depicted in Fig.
Moreover, the stability of out-of-sample errors was evaluated through box-plots."
194,"Thus, in quinary encoding the difference d is encoded using five values according to two thresholds τ
1 and τ
2, as described in Equation 2.
It uncovers the effect of doubling c1 with respect to case A, maintaining the same value for c2.
Fig 9 depicts the results for Case C. It uncovers the effect of reducing c2 to a third of that in Case A, maintaining the same value for c1.
Case D sees c1 triple with respect to Case A, maintaining the same value of c2.
Finally, Case E triples c1 with respect to Case A while reducing c2 by two thirds.
We normalize b = 1 and choose c = 33.
Last, we only replaced d with d + 1 to calculate them.
To make conversions between them; consider the original diameter interval d0 to d0+ dd0, and its corresponding intervals de to de + dde and dD to dD + ddD."
195,"Our paper contributes to this stream of the literature by using Twitter-based scraped data, rather than Google Trends data, which give only relative numbers rather than absolute numbers.
Twitter’s centralized trending feature is yet another dimension that alters the popularity of terms on the platform, personalizing each user timeline and inherently amplifying algorithmic bias.
Besides tweet volumes, we also explore the collected dataset from the perspective of Twitter users.
For data, we use Twitter as a vast, noisy, and distributed news and opinion aggregation service [19–23].
We show that Twitter is an effective source for our treatment though our methods may be applied broadly to any temporally ordered, text-rich data sources.
Analysis of Twitter data takes the form of two, often combined, approaches, namely content-based and network-based."
196,"CCS emphasizes close collaborations among stakeholders when tackling local concerns.
Complementing RtD that creates prototypes as proof-of-concept, CCS develops functional systems that can be deployed and used by local people.
Unlike service design, citizens’ roles extend beyond service consumers to co-designers who co-create knowledge and systems with scientists and other stakeholders.
Due to its region-based characteristics, CCS often involves many local stakeholders—including communities, citizens, scientists, designers, and policy makers—with complex relationships.
CCS projects will succeed when designers and scientists see themselves as citizens, and in turn, when local communities and citizens see themselves as innovators.
The CCS framework provides a promising path toward these goals.
CCS provides a sustainable way to co-create high-quality regional datasets while simultaneously increasing citizens’ self-efficacy in addressing local problems.
We also proposed CCS approaches to simultaneously addressing local societal issues and advancing science."
197,"In our model, all the agents who are not infected, with the exception of those recently recovered, are susceptible to COVID‐19.
In the earliest phases of the COVID-19 epidemic, testing for acute infection may not have been done.
Susceptible agents with COVID‐19‐like symptoms do not exist in the model until the onset of testing.
Asymptomatic individuals were exposed to the virus but clinical signs of COVID have not yet developed.
In this context, note that noninfected individuals can have symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, as many symptoms are rather unspecific.
Viral RNA was found even for those who never developed COVID-19 symptoms, i.e., who always remained asymptomatic."
198,"Although recent contextual models are increasingly dominant, we still see demand for lexicon-based models because of their interpretability and ease of use.
Given an input word, we look up its definition via a free online dictionary API available at https://dictionaryapi.dev.
We only use the word as input to our model for terms without definitions.
Another key factor that plays a big role in our prediction error is obtaining good word definitions, or the lack thereof, to use as input for our Dictionary model.
Surprisingly, outsourcing definitions from online dictionaries for a large set of words is rather challenging, especially if you opt-out of reliable but paid services.
In our work, we choose not to use an urban dictionary or any services with paid APIs.
We use a free online dictionary API that is available at https://dictionaryapi.dev.
Most of these words are names, abbreviations, and slang terms (e.g., “xams,” “foto,” “nvm,” and “lmao”).
We recommend using the Dictionary model whenever it is possible to outsource a good definition of the word."
199,"Further, the community-driven development of software tools in this case was proven to be fast and precise, driven by society participation.
For this goal to be realized, everyone on the global stage must have access to the software and various web platforms used.
Having setup this basic framework, many different directions of enquiry are available to us.
The modularity can be achieved by designing suitable smart contract deployment plans.
Specifically, we call for the community to look more at “higher-level tools and systems” that enable end-users to complete tasks.
The systems and control community has powerful tools available to contribute and take on this fundamental challenge.
Thus, there is a need to develop plug-and-play solutions that can be easily deployed and used by people who are not necessarily tech-savvy."
200,"In late 2017, the advent of deep attention-based models, dubbed transformers, rapidly changed the landscape in the NLP community (Vaswani et al., 2017).
The transformers that we compared include BERT and SciBERT [31].
Our experiments comparing BERT, BioBERT and SciBERT showed that models using SciBERT constantly outperformed their counterparts though the results with the other two transformers are competitive.
In recent years, Transformer has been proven to perform well in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation ([24]).
For example, [23] and [48] encoded all news through the Transformer encoder to generate the representation of the news and extract text features for subsequent calculations.
There are a few ways to adapt transformers for profile classification."
201,"Covering a date range from January 25 to May 10, 2020, we collected more than 170 million tweets generated by 2.7 million unique users.
They collected tweets from Jan 20 to Mar 20 and inferred user classification from Twitter user profiles.
The training set was sampled from Twitter data collected between December 2017 and January 2020.
This calls for additional sampling of a considerably larger set of potentially violent tweets, which should be properly annotated and then used for model training.
We generate two other datasets from this which feature the regions of Maharashtra (state) and Delhi (union territory) which contains around 18,000 tweets each, respectively.
Fig 2 shows the distribution of number of tweets for selected months along with the number of cases for the respective datasets.
The number of tweets gradually increased with peak of tweets in July (Fig 2, Panel a)."
202,"Concerning COVID-19, as for most infectious diseases, it quickly became apparent that some of the disease characteristics are strongly age-dependent [1].
Deaths are reliably recorded and clinical grounds for suspecting Covid‐19 are relatively clear for fatal cases, although accurately attributing death to a single cause is clearly not always possible.
[21] investigated the effect of population age on the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients by utilising numerical modelling.
This aspect is particularly important for realistic predictions of COVID‐19, which is significantly more severe and fatal among the older population.
The average age of 26 COVID-19 confirmed individuals is about 55 years old, according to the age information supplied.
In brief, we can observe notable differences in contribution to the COVID-19 positive cases and death tolls across specific demographic attributes (e.g., older age)."
203,"We note that our approach of data collection from online sources is widely used in different disciplines [31]–[33], and known as netnography [34].
In order to obtain our research objective, we conducted a systematic review of the online content.
As the topic is still emerging and there are no academic literature available in this area, we followed an online content review approach to attain our research objectives.
We note that online content review approach is widely accepted in research, and popularly known as digital ethnography, online ethnography and netnography [19].
Google search engine was used to find the related online content.
The online content were analysed through systematic coding and interpretation.
The flowchart of inclusion and exclusion process to select the online resources or electronic resources for content analysis is shown in Figure 3."
204,"Namely, the website directly integrates external services so that users can obtain more information about selected variants at the click of a button.
To understand the overall theme of topics, two coders qualitatively investigated each topic following two steps.
In the second step, the coders used consensus coding [55] to identify a theme and create a label for each topic.
The comments were meticulously read to notice, and code as we discussed above.
The assigned keywords or codes were then collected and categorized to represent common themes.
After that, both researchers thought about their coding to refine, verify and update the code names, categorizations, relations among the categorizations.
Finally, all authors met to compare the coding and classifications.
The selected article were reviewed systematically for coding (after extracting related data) and interpretation.
For instance, each website represented in the training data is represented by a code, and as a result generated text can switch styles based on these prefixes."
205,"Could COVID-19 trigger a Global Epidemic Research Program, intensive investigation in the topic, and an expanded observing system producing accurate and publicly available data?
As the year progressed and the virus spread to pandemic migrated West, more and more research organisations in the West turned their attention to COVID-19 research.
Real-world problems in science and technology cannot be solved adequately using the knowledge from any single discipline (Bruine de Bruin and Morgan 2019), and COVID-19 related issues are no exception.
Then, we point out several important challenges and potential future directions in Section VII for applying these technologies in COVID-19 epidemic.
Furthermore, knowledge gap (in form of ignorance and lack of intelligence) on the part of leadership and society is another factor hampering the containment of COVID-19, based on our findings.
The study presented here is an extension of an earlier one done on the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic [5]."
206,"It is worth discussing further the importance of TFP growth in this context.
In this model, there is a strong interaction between the TFP growth rate and the elasticity of production with respect to capital, as these directly affect production growth.
Without modeling those events in detail, projected growth can model the long-term average growth rate.
In case of a negative extreme event, a smaller growth rate can model the long-term impact caused by the slow down.
Similarly, a positive extreme event can be modeled as larger growth rate to include the long-term impact by the rapid growth.
If we are trying to reduce the growth rate k, it can be done in two ways:"
207,"The final model is constructed with the final chosen lags based on the CCF plot and the ARIMA model.
To select the best ARIMA and final cross‐correlation models, we start the fitting with all the candidate time lags, then use backward selection.
The ARIMA(12, 1, 0) model omitting orders 1, 8, 9, and 10 are used.
An ARIMA(19, 1, 0) keeping orders at 1 to 4, and 19 is chosen.
To define the ARIMA order, grid-search is adopted, and the most suitable order is that reach a lower Akaike and Bayesian Akaike criteria information.
First, we fitted the individual models ARIMA, ETS, THETAM, TBATS, and NNETAR by calling the functions “auto.arima,” “ets,” “thetam,” “tbats,” and “nneta,” respectively."

209,"In equal-size binning, resulting bins have an equal number of observations in each group.
The ranking level is represented by three colours: green (good performance), yellow (moderate performance), and red (poor performance).
This is sufficient to represent them graphically in a histogram with the respective number of bins.
The bin counts are divided into classes to ease visual comparisons between bins.
Darker colored bins represent areas that have a larger number of place mentions within the bin.
The results of choosing different numbers of bins (5, 20, and 80) is shown in S3 Fig.
The difference in the concentration densities between 5 bins and 20 bins is substantial, but the difference between 20 and 80 is small."
210,"The first Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) transformed random noise vectors to new image data.Olson et al.
where G is the generator of the first GAN and DY the discriminator of the same GAN.
Therefore, that first GAN learns the translation from images of domain X to images of domain Y.
The objective of the second GAN, which consists of a generator F and a discriminator DX, is defined analogously.
Future work has to investigate if our GAN-based approach can be modified to cope with 3D structures (e.g., MRT data) in order to cover a wider range of practical scenarios.
8, we compare the discriminator loss of our advanced FL scheme and the standalone scheme with GAN [39], which only trains the GAN model using its dataset without the federation.
To improve perceptual quality, the GCN is employed as the generator in a generative adversarial network.
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are also adopted to better model the nonlinear prediction mapping and performance improvement."
211,"staff did not immediately appear to be at greater risk following the return of more students.
Even when a large portion of the population is infected, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals continue their typical routines: attending class, socializing, and using common spaces on campus as usual.
Note that a related study [9] predicted that 100% of the campus population would become infected about halfway into a semester with no intervention.
These groups included residential, close academic, classroom contact, broad social, etc., and contact came with varying likelihoods of passing an infection.
Lastly, a dedensified campus will naturally have fewer initially infected agents.
Commuting and/or meeting in the office might trigger the infection.
This happens predominantly for the chief offices if no infected person ever enters the office throughout the day."
212,"The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 are still under heavy investigation.
Two distinct perspectives were conducted to identify and classify COVID-19.
One important limitation of this study is the relatively small cohort size for patients with COVID-19.
Studies have also been performed in pregnant women with COVID-19.
In this study, two main issues related to COVID-19 were examined.

213,"We do not think that taking into account more colors could produce a different finding.
To aid the interpretation of the model performance, a traffic light color scheme is employed in highlighting the obtained metrics at each sensor location.

215,"The choice of incidence is consistent with the CDC recommendation for states to track the trajectories of COVID-19 infections along with other metrics.
First, raw data on COVID-19 incidence for each day and state is gathered and the seven-day moving average is calculated.
Using these variables, seven parameters local regression models were developed for COVID-19 counts, with the cumulative sum values accounted.
The hourly distribution patterns changed in Phase 2 when confirmed COVID-19 cases increased quickly in the United States.
First, the reported counts of COVID-19 may have been under-reported [63] throughout the pandemic.

216,"Noting the different time scales shown, the chain rapidly converges on its endemic state while the star undergoes drastic oscillations before convergence.
We show that there exists a critical time [Image: see text] above which the giant susceptible component is destroyed.
We show that the temporal decreasing of the size of the giant susceptible cluster can be described as a dynamic void node percolation process with an instantaneous void control parameter.
Then we study the evolution of the giant susceptible cluster and its temporal critical behavior.
(1)), these probabilities satisfy the relation(11)where  is the generating function of the neighbor of a root not connected to the giant susceptible cluster.From Eq.
Thus our process can be explained by a dynamic percolation with an instantaneous void transmissibility .

219,"About 97% of the infected individuals will recover after period ranging between one to four weeks.
Thus, 1η is the average number of days it takes an exposed individual to become infective.
Accordingly, around 3.2 days will typically pass before the infection is detected (95%-CI [1.92–5.55], 1/η).
The infected individual can transmit the disease 1 - 3 days before the onset of symptoms [1].
Thus, the interval between exposure and becoming infectious is estimated to be 4 (mean) days [6], [32], [33], [34], [35].
Consider the spread of infectious diseases with a recovery period up to T days."
220,"It is possible, however, that a diagnosed infected person could have transmitted the disease to other people before getting diagnosed.
Depending on the disease it mimics, individuals can be infectious or not.
Susceptible, infectious, asymptomatic infectious, hospitalized, and recovered are classic examples.
First of all, it has been reported  [28], [29] that an important fraction of those who are carrying the virus is asymptomatic.
Further, there are many who have milder or asymptomatic cases and are never officially diagnosed as “infected,” but who may still spread the disease.
Also, we differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, considering different levels of illness severity for symptomatic patients."
221,"The snapshot approach crucially depends on the representation of time in the network relations.
The set of network snapshots thus consists of 133 overlapping observation windows, with temporal delay of one week.
The chosen sliding window of one week provides high temporal resolution, but again the choice of this parameter is not crucial.
This results in 133 snapshot windows, labeled with weeks t = 0, 1, …, 132 (see Fig 1).
We therefore implement a heuristic procedure to find a fixed number of intermediate snapshots which maximize the differences between them.
The set of network snapshots thus consists of 133 overlapping observation windows, with temporal delay of one week."
222,"As a final remark, we stress the fact that full and localized isolation of blocks solely occurs in GLs and LLs, respectively.
But, in IGLs there is no isolation of the blocks at all.
The GLs means that people remain confined within the block where she (he) lives.
We assume, however, that people may still get in contact within their own block.
In this case we model a situation in which the GLs cannot be implemented.
As in the case of the GLs, we assume that people from an isolated block may still get in contact within this block."
223,"The distributions over time for N = 100 and N = 1000 are virtually indistinguishable as long as the initial infectious individuals are kept in the same ratio.
Therefore, we introduce a random perturbation in the infection or mortality rate, in each state.
This yields that a solution for infection probability is time-dependent, but spatially uniform.
We generalize this theory for spatially variable situations in Appendix B by replacing the spatial-averaging by ensemble averaging in the definition of the infection probability.
In the spirit of simplicity, we also choose the time of the infection uniformly at random between the beginning and end of the contact data set.
(2)
The parameter Cv is the capacity of v and rv ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3} is the risk multiplier for infection spread in that space.
Important extensions include time dependent contact rates [29] and multiple infectious stages occurring in parallel [30].
The simulation starts with the introduction of an infected individual in state I."
224,"In practice, the ECE metric is computed as the weighted average of the difference between the predicted probabilities and accuracy in each bin.
The CI values are also used to observe if there exists a statistically significant difference in the ECE metric before and after calibration.
Table 3 and Fig 3 show the ECE metric achieved using various calibration methods.
For the Set-20 and Set-60 datasets constructed from the APTOS’19 fundus dataset, Platt calibration demonstrated the least ECE metric compared to other calibration methods.
For the Set-100 dataset, spline calibration demonstrated the least ECE metric.
We observed that the spline, beta, and Platt calibration methods demonstrated the least ECE metric respectively for the Set-20, Set-60, and Set-100 datasets.
The difference in the ECE metric is not statistically significant (p > 0.05) across the calibration methods.
This observation is evident from the polar coordinates plot shown in Fig 3 where the ECE values obtained with calibrated probabilities are smaller compared to those obtained with uncalibrated probabilities."
225,"In addition, Kij=ViVjBij, where Bij is the susceptance of the transmission line connecting buses i and j and Vi and Vj are the voltage magnitudes at these buses.
If there is no line connecting buses i and j, Kij = 0.
On the other hand, Cij represents the fraction of those individuals leaving i that go to region j.
If a pair of links is present between ni and nj,lij=lji=1.
It is postulated that the total number of persons who moves from ni to nj per a unit time is proportional to kikj if a link is present.
If a link from ni to nj is present, lij is 1.
The probability at which a link is present between ni and nj (lij=lji=1) is a constant 〈ki〉/(N−1).
It is postulated that the total number of persons who move from ni to nj per a unit time is proportional to kikj if a link is present."
226,"Historically, the single spreading dynamics was placed in a well-mixed population, without any differences among individuals [4], [10].
This is in contrast to conventional models which assume full mixing across the country.
is that the perfect mixing assumption smooths over much of the structure inherent to a campus.
Since the last century, it has already been understood that the transmission dynamics are not sufficiently modeled by assuming homogeneous mixing.
To focus our model on the general spreading dynamics, we made simplifying assumptions: We assumed that spreading happens homogeneously in the population, with neither regional nor age-related differences.
This parameter is, by definition, impossible to measure, but it is typically the main driver of the spreading dynamics.
The environment could also be split into coupled well-mixed zones with weaker mixing between them [7, 33], but that shall not be considered here."
227,"In addition to the total number of links between the two regions, the intensity of such links compared with those with others is also important.
These links function as corridors for mobility across different geographies.
Another critical link emerged in Texas, which further separates the West Pacific and the West South Central regions.
These key links, located across the United States, played a key role as valves connecting components in divisions and regions.
In Boston, a river separates the city into two parts, which (to all extent) can be considered as equivalent to two islands.
The transportation between two regions is a pair of unidirectional links."
228,"For governments, the situations of epidemics could be apperceived, and effective containment measures could be provided [6].
[309] examined how two countries would allocate resources at the onset of an epidemic when they seek to protect their own populations.
This can provide insights into the epidemiological situation and identify whether outbreak control measures have significant effects, [1].
The task of determining these properties is additionally hampered by limited data availability and integrity within the early outbreak phase.
Thus, it can help us to improve the epidemic risk calculations [16].
Being able to estimate the amount of resources that will be needed, as the epidemic progresses, is a key aspect that authorities should seek in order to implement appropriate policies."
229,"From Figure 2
a, it can be seen that there is a significant decrease in the severity of infections as soon as social distancing is enforced.
As the distance threshold of social distancing is increased, the severity of infections decreases, following a negative logarithmic trend.
Social distancing has the highest value of μi*, meaning the peak of the infection curve is very sensitive to the measure.
Our results confirm that reduced social activity lowers the infection rate, accounting for regional and temporal patterns.
Essentially, this means that voluntary social distancing can significantly reduce the total amount of infections R(∞).
Next, we want to analyse how the perceived cost of social distancing Csd as well as the perceived cost of infection CI influence the total amount of infections R(∞)."
230,"The present study fills the above gaps in research on network interventions and regional interactions.
The importance of loops in the diffusion of the economic effects in networks is not fully recognised, either in academic literature or in policymaking.
We carry out the intervention methods on Scenario 3, the geometric scale-free network model.
We model intervention (A), keeping physical distance by randomly removing connections from the network.
To summarize, we conclude that the effect of interventions vary to a high extent and depend on the precise way the intervention changes the network topology.
The comprehensive experiments we conducted in this section show that intervention strategies that rely on LF betweenness are more effective than interventions based on other network centrality measures."
231,"The coevolution spreading dynamics in complex networks has thus attracted much attention in many disciplines.
For the coevolution on single networks, the network topology (e.g., degree distribution and clustering) remarkably affects the coevolution spreading dynamics.
In this review, we presented the state of the art of the progress of coevolution spreading dynamics on complex networks.
Another important aspect is that the coevolution spreading dynamics are largely affected by the network topology.
To get analytical solutions of the coevolution spreading dynamics, most previous studies made some assumptions about the network topology, such as that the network is large, sparse, local-tree-like, or static.
Following the removal of each group of edges ranked by each control strategy, the spreading simulations were repeated.
Stochastic and network effects—in combination with the underlying nonlinear spreading dynamics—are relevant as well.
A comparison of the spreading dynamics on the original and shuffled networks determines the impact of that specific temporal correlation on the dynamics."
232,"In this review, we introduce recent progress in the study of coevolution spreading dynamics, emphasizing the contributions from the perspectives of statistical mechanics and network science.
[171] found that the heterogeneities of the weight distribution show a nonmonotonous effect on the spreading dynamics, which can accelerate or decelerate cascade processes.
The landscape of the studies on coevolution spreading dynamics is presented in Fig.
Once the human dynamics are included, the interaction patterns and transmissibility among nodes will be affected, and thus the coevolution spreading will also be affected.
The resilience of coevolution spreading is a potentially interesting topic.
They revealed the critical slowing down and critical speeding up for coevolution dynamics, which are markedly different from single spreading.
Because the resilience depends on the dynamical process, do there exist some common characteristics for the resilience of coevolution spreading dynamics?
For a given coevolution spreading process, how might its resilience be estimated?
We should note that an effective vital node identification algorithm may not work for coevolution spreading dynamics."
233,"The framework is also capable of learning the node grouping and extracts graph features jointly, providing the flexibility to choose between individual-level and group-level explanations.
Graph based mapping with label representations (word embeddings) that guide the information propagation among nodes has been explored [187].
The concept of word embeddings can also be applied to networks, where node presentations embody their homophily and structural similarity [34].
Similar to how word or sentence embeddings can be generated text, we can generate node embeddings for nodes in a network.
Such node embeddings can capture network structure similarities and homophily.
One network embedding model is node2vec [49], which learns node embeddings from random walks over the network.
GraphSAGE [50] is another network embedding method that also utilizes node attributes and is inductive, meaning it can be applied to isolated nodes.
Another popular network-based method for node classification is label propagation, which deterministically propagates labels from seed users in the network."
234,"We are raising here very fundamental questions in epidemic reporting.
With this, we will be in a position to assess the level of under-reporting in a particular epidemic.
So the strategy we are proposing could be beneficial in not only building a true epidemic but also assessing the level of reporting error in an epidemic.
In the following, we will investigate to what extent such issues may undermine an accurate assessment of the state of epidemics, even if a large amount of data is available.
The precondition for accurate predictions is to have reliable measurement methods judging the actual state of epidemics well.
By contrast, our contribution will highlight problems related to monitoring epidemics by measurement processes.
The core question of this paper is: how well can the state of epidemics be measured using common test and monitoring methods?
Regarding the second point, one needs to consider errors of tests and estimation procedures underlying epidemic monitoring."
235,"Smooth infection curves are preferred in order to avoid stressing the medical care system.
The infection curve smoothens and widens as the mobility switches from 0% to 20%.
As a result of the local measures that are present in Scenario 2, the curve of infections shows two smaller waves instead of one large wave, see Fig.
Figure 3d shows that isolating cases alone reduces the peak of the infection curve in a linear manner.
(2)On the other hand, these smaller waves of infection can cause the development of another wave of infection.
An increase in κ thus causes a decrease in the duration in the waves of infection as well as smaller maxima and larger minima."
236,"Second, the spreading between cities, over the airline network, now depends on the number of seats in airline connections between cities.
Indeed, previous findings10 show that the most highly connected cities in the airline system do not necessarily have the highest node centrality.
In the transportation network studied, this means higher ranked individual connections could be cancelled instead of isolating whole cities from the rest of the world.
Including airports with lower traffic volumes might preferable include national and regional airports within network modules.
The network of connections between the top 500 airports is available under the resources link on our website http://www.biological-networks.org.
This way both strategies did not change in the number of passengers departing from each city, only the connectivity structure was modified."
237,"This could be mark against our approach, but one should note that seroprevalence-based infection estimates are conservative [28].
As these can affect the progression of the infection we must make assumptions about them.
In particular, we focused on the early stages of the infection, i.e.
It also seems likely that infection rates may affect behaviour in return (we explore this possibility in Section 4).
This is especially true during the first wave of infections.
However, we also note that infections after the first wave of infection only emerge due to the oscillatory tragedy of the commons.
(2)When decreasing I∗ too much, this can lead to the development of a new wave of infections."
238,"The configuration model is a well-studied object in mathematical network science, dating back to Bollobás [10] and Molloy and Reed [46], [47].
The erased configuration model can be obtained by erasing all self-loops and multiple edges between nodes.
For a mathematical overview on the properties of the configuration model and erased configuration model, see [34].
In this case, the node-degrees in the erased configuration model version also follow (2), with the same exponent τ.
Mathematical results suggest that snapshots of this model behave, again, qualitative similarly to the configuration model with similar degree structure, although numerical values might differ [5], [21], [23], [25].
An important feature of the configuration model is the small-world property."
239,"Visibly, for both of the latter cases, the acquisition composite score takes low values.
Both scores take into consideration n, the number of observations.
If we now observe y = 190, i.e., a count considerably higher than suggested by either F or G, the 2 scores yield different results, as illustrated in Fig 3.
The calculation returned a high score of 0.5641 (see Fig.
As a result, both false positives and false negatives are included while calculating this score.
In this case, CL produced negative scores, which is quite an unexpected behavior."
240,"(42).Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analyses on different types of artificial multiplex networks, Wang et al.
Our theory demonstrates that the existence of such topology-driven instabilities is generic in multiplex networks, providing a new mechanism of pattern formation.
As a particular example we consider the Mimura-Murray ecological model42 on a multiplex network consisting of two scale-free layers.
Recently, new algorithms for building multiplex networks with positive or negative degree correlations across the layers have been proposed43444546.
Multiplex networks can be used to represent different types of interaction353741 or different transportation lines384047 between discrete nodes.
In ecological multiplex networks, for example, pairs of nodes might represent separate habitat patches which communicate through dispersal connections.
The multiplex networks used in our numerical simulations consist of two separate layers and two different types of links, intra-layer and inter-layer links.
Intra-layer links are described by the adjacency matrices and limit the diffusional mobility of the species."
241,"Finally, the four affinity diagrams (by four authors) were analyzed together to review the grouping or clustering.
Thereafter, we came up with one affinity diagram with the final clustering.
We expect this dataset can facilitate research on coarse graining and the graph partition problem.
Then, based on affinity matrix A, spectral clustering is used to obtain the graph clustering result.
This is an expected result as we use spectral clustering in the inference stage of our model.
In spectral clustering, METIS methods and our model the resolution of the CG mapping can be controlled as the number of partitions is a hyper parameter.
There exist spectral [45–49] and combinatorial [44, 50–53] methods for local graph clustering.
A number of clustering algorithms have been proposed for graphs and bipartite graphs in the literature [3–7]."
242,"interfaces are compatible if and only if the (p, q) gradients are rank-1 connected.
In [8], we characterized the four and only four types of compatible interfaces by finding the structural parameters and interfaces (p^(s),q^(s)) that satisfy (2.8).
Examples of the compatible interfaces are shown in figure 1b: vertical, horizontal, helical, and elliptical interfaces.
Among them, the horizontal and elliptical interfaces are mobile (figure 1c), whereas the vertical and helical interfaces are stabilized by the global compatibility of the structure (figure 1d).
The phase transformation will induce macroscopic twist and extension for the horizontal and elliptical interfaces, while slip is required (and can be quantified) for the vertical and helical interfaces.
Following the generalized local and global compatibilities (see [9]), an HMO can have multiple phases separated by compatible interfaces and still remain compatible as a cylindrical structure (figure 2d)."
243,"The instability leads to the spontaneous emergence of stationary patterns consisting of nodes with high or low densities of activators26.
Three pairs of nodes, the critical ones, denoted by stars, have degrees exceeding the instability threshold.
The critical node denoted by the red star is the first to spontaneously leave the uniform state, as shown in Fig.
3c,d show that the critical nodes denoted by the green and blue stars rapidly differentiate from the uniform state.
Finally, triggered by these growing perturbations, other nodes leave the steady state to establish a non-uniform pattern (Fig.
Under the influence of small perturbations, some critical nodes differentiate rapidly from the uniform steady state."
244,"Although the concept of machine learning is common among computer scientists, it can seem mysterious to citizens.
A second reason to avoid unsupervised methods is that I want to study predetermined job categories e.g.
The development of machine learning based methods has already demonstrated their promising applications in this problem [8, 10, 15, 31, 49].
Machine Learning (ML) has demonstrated itself as a specific research field in the recent decade [17] by solving numerous exceptionally complex and advanced real-world problems [18].
Many machine learning and AI techniques have also been explored [66], [40], [57], [35].
The pressure to publish “good” results can aggravate methodological loopholes84, for instance gaming the evaluation in machine learning85.
With the advances of data-driven machine learning research, a wide variety of prediction problems have been tackled.
In traditional machine learning, the standard algorithm theory is to learn one task when the output of the system is a real number."
245,"However, this comes at higher computational cost, so that the level of approximation needs to be balanced with computational considerations.
If the discretization is too coarse, the algorithm will introduce truncation errors.
If, however, the discretization is too granular, computational times will be prohibitively long.
This is illustrated by a guiding example for which we also analyse the approximation quality and highlight the gain in computational efficiency.
This motivates us to consider approximate modeling approaches which reduce the numerical effort.
While latter error can easily be monitored by estimating the neglected cross-over rates, controlling the discretization error is more difficult.
Extension based on other approximation methods such as numerical quadrature is an important remining task.
For example, smoothing along a random direction can be less effective while being computationally expensive in all directions.
This format was used in [70] for studying the impact of discretization and is appropriate if the focus is mainly on the anomaly (sub)types and few algorithms are being compared."
246,"A CNN can facilitate the extraction of useful features and enhance the prediction accuracy of RNN-based models.
The model is a parallel combination of CNN and RNN.
CNN and RNN allow capturing the spatial and temporal correlation present in input sensor data, respectively.
Activation vector for a window is the concatenation of the CNN and RNN outputs for the window data.
Concatenation of CNN and RNN Outputs: The outputs of the CNN and RNN are concatenated.
As mentioned before, the concatenated vector (or activation vector) of the CNN and RNN outputs are incorporated with the input features of the next window.
Since CNN is easy to parallelize, it is not suitable for capturing dependencies within the field sequence."
247,"Clustering is a widely observed characteristic of disparate networks [65].
However, the effects of clustering seem to be dependent on the underlying network models.
Mathematically, clustering means the presence of triangles in the network.
Mathematically, clustering means the presence of triangles in the network.
Besides locality, one can show that fs* induces a local graph clustering bias for appropriately chosen λ.
This local graph clustering bias plays a crucial role in our experiment."
248,"Note that G is a multigraph, and allows for parallel arcs corresponding to different modes and frequencies.
We demonstrate a supervised learning based approach using a graph neural network framework, Deep Supervised Graph Partitioning Model (DSGPM).
GCNs, however, can be applied to graphs with a varying number of nodes and connectivity [20].
They showed that their spectral graph matching method not only outperforms non-graph matching but is also superior to individual subject classification and manifold learning methods.
[69] proposed a bootstrapped version of GCNs that made models less sensitive to the initialisation of the construction of the population graph.
Spectral GCNs cannot be used to compare multiple graphs directly and need an explicit alignment of graph eigenbases as an additional pre-processing step.
Then, a GCN predicts the refined subgraph that corresponds to the structure of interest in a supervised setting, where edge probabilities are predicted from learnt edge embeddings.
This raises the question of whether going deeper is still a good strategy for learning from graph data [205]."
249,"Finally, using a Softmax classifier, the processed signals are categorized.
By varying the number of lower-order MFCCs to keep (from 13 to 65, with steps of 13), the spectral resolution of the features was varied.
Thus, SFS could select from a total of 42 features: MFCCs along with their velocity (Δ) and accelerations (ΔΔ), log frame energy, ZCR and Kurtosis (Equation (5)).

) and they include MFCCs ranging from 3 to 12 along with their velocity (Δ) and acceleration (ΔΔ), suggesting all dimensions of feature matrix carry equally-important COVID-19 signatures.
The number of extracted MFCCs (M) lies between 13 and 65, and the number of linearly-spaced filterbanks (B) between 40 and 200.
The input feature matrix to the classifiers has the dimension of (3M+2,S) for M MFCCs along with their M velocity and M acceleration coefficients, as shown in Fig."
250,"Next, we trained a machine learning model, SVM (Support Vector Machine) on the features collected from the videos to classify PD and non-PD.
After the feature extraction process, a customized top layer is used, which works as the classifier shown in Fig.
Additionally, the gradient-based class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) [59] was used to represent the decision area on a heatmap.
The combination of orthogonal viewpoints can result in more discriminative features, leading to an improved classification system.
For reliable analysis, it is critical to learn discriminative low-dimensional intrinsic features.
These features are combined via a dot product and a linear projection with trainable weights.
A brief introduction on the rationale behind each pre-trained model used in this work is provided in Section 2."
251,"Community detection algorithms have different weaknesses, but the instability of the results is their common issue in the temporal scenarios.
To address this issue, we propose an Ensemble Louvain algorithm which to some extend solves the instability of the well-known Louvain algorithm for community detection.
A standard community detection method is the Louvain algorithm [21].
One problem is the instability of detected static communities by a standard community detection Louvain algorithm.
The exiting problem, worth addressing in the future, is how to design a multi-stage super-community detection algorithm.
We are not the first to use ensembles for community detection.
A standard community detection method is the Louvain algorithm [47].
In order to identify node clusters, we exploit the Louvain algorithm of community detection, whose performance is counted among the best methods [75].
SVA then applies the Louvain community detection algorithm [61] on a given co-citation network to identify such document groupings as described above.
To obtain C and Q, the Louvain community detection algorithm is used [61]."
252,"Generally speaking, nodes within a community are densely connected, whereas nodes between communities are sparsely connected.
Informally, a network community is a subset of nodes more densely linked between themselves than with the nodes outside the community.
There are several measures to evaluate network communities, in particular in relation to the “ground truth”.
Therefore it is crucial that the community similarity measure takes new and lost nodes into account.
Informally, a network community is a subset of nodes more densely linked between themselves than with the nodes outside the community.
There are several measures to evaluate and compare network communities.
Communities are parts of the network that have significantly more connections than the same number of randomly selected nodes.
An assemblage of cliques through shared edges/interactions is defined as communities (details in the section Network Parameters of the PScN)."
253,"The images were acquired with Photron FastCam Viewer (software package 4.0.3.4.
The repeatability of the software to obtain consistent results on the same image was also verified.
This outcome is notable given that the same software was used to process and analyze all three images.
This gives us the image intensity values that can be displayed on standard monitors and Android devices.
This process is useful not only for training, but it also makes it easier to display the files in PNG format on Android OS-dependent devices.
The image processing module of OpenCV is again put to use.
Lastly, three apps were found to incorporate an obsolete version (v1.5.3) of the libjpeg [88] library, used to read and write JPEG image files.
Both the images are borrowed from Wikipedia under the license CC BY-SA 3.0.
Both platforms can read and write annotations using the ImageScope XML format,[52] and we have used that format to share ROIs and create an identical study on both platforms."
254,"In Section 2, we briefly describe the most common graph-based deep learning models used in this domain, including GCNs and its variants, with temporal dependencies and attention structures.
[97] proposed an Attention-Guided Deep Graph Neural (AGDGN) network model to derive both structural and temporal graph features from the ADNI dataset [98].
Building graph generation models using neural networks has also attracted increasing attention to model graphs with complicated topologies and constrained structural properties (e.g., GraphGAN [188]).
Recent advances in distributed and batch training for graph neural networks look promising but they require hours of CPU training, even for small and medium sized graphs.
Interpretability for graph-based deep learning is significantly more challenging than for CNN or RNN-based models because graph nodes and edges are often heavily interconnected.
The adoption of graph-based deep learning models have also been explored for the analysis of human actions.
Graph representations for skeleton-based action recognition are gaining prominence over the last couple of years.
In recent years, graph neural networks have received a lot of attention."
255,"After extracting the aforementioned features, we concatenated them to form a 938 × 193 feature matrix.
A layer of regions is detected with a search method and fed into a fully connected layer creating feature vector and passed through SoftMax classifier to predict object.
The resultant classification is performed using a conventional dense layer and activation.
These feature vectors are input into fully connected layers for classification.
Finally, intermediate classifications are also performed to reinforce the final network output and improve the network gradient throughout its training.
To this end, while the classifier of this model receives as input a feature vector of dimension 1024, the intermediate classifiers are fed with vectors of size 2048.
As a result, the parameter number reduction allows for more feature maps to be generated in deeper layers to enhance the model accuracy.
The baseline systems B8, B9 and B10 are trained directly on the primary features, without pre-training."
256,"In the experiments on the proposed architecture, we have explored the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014), which can converge faster.
Like the projected gradient method, Adam is not guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution of the problem.
However, provided that the initial conditions and the learning rate ϵ are chosen with care, Adam has been observed to typically output a local minimum that is “good enough”.
During the training, the standard batch gradient descent method [66, 67] with the error back-propagation algorithm was performed using the Adam algorithm with the default settings [68].
We train the modified architecture with the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer.
A GPU implementation accelerates the forward propagation and back propagation routines by using the Adam optimizer under the Pytorch framework."
257,"This process reduces the possibility of bias via eliminating some artifacts from images, such as captions, annotations, which may deceive the model.
For machines, even the information that images from one data resource are relatively darker might be relevant.
Such images should be removed while checking the database contents.
The model may take into greater consideration other image features than it should.
Such images should be removed during data resource verification before model training.
Another worth mentioning information concerning the database is that we have manually cut the images edges in order to avoid the recognition of undesirable patterns.
Image reduction to deal with too much complexity always runs a risk of loss of potentially relevant information."
258,"This situation leads to increasing the number of input neurons in the neural network by three times.
The number of neurons in the hidden layers was 50.
The fully connected network has 3 layers, each having a hidden state vector size of 250.
It is noticed that the network output retains almost the same when the number of hidden layers exceeds 5.
Only a neuron avails for each type of output; therefore, in the case of the COVID-19 dataset, this layer contains two neurons for their types.
The proposed model's final structure was determined as 120 input neurons, 120 hidden neurons, and output neurons based on the number of classes.
The first layer of neurons or input layer receives each of the elements of the input vector xi and transmits them to the second (hidden) layer."
259,"To facilitate this, I have also developed a web application where this data set can be queried through a dashboard interface.
I have created such a dashboard and made it available online at https://jobtrender.com/.
Data were gathered from the github repository associated with the interactive dashboard hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA [1].
The application displays the results and also stores them in a cloud database.
We visualized the results on a dashboard that queries the UPHO through its application programming interface and provides the features explained below.
The dashboard queries the repository of generated analytical results and renders the results on a tabbed view.
In this section, we have provided use case scenarios for each of the 4 different users to demonstrate the features available in the dashboard through the first scenario.
We used scenario 1 to explore the capabilities of the UPHO surveillance platform and the dashboard features.
We used the UPHO user-centered platform to show how these 3 goals are achieved through the distinctive features of the dashboard."
260,"Accordingly, a valuable line of research is to connect the temporal network structure to the theory of concurrent partnerships, which is this review’s topic.
Given a temporal network, a partnership is a set of events between a pair of individuals such that the events are sufficiently evenly distributed.
Sometimes, we let the edges of a partnership network appear and disappear over time to generate a dynamic partnership network [17,37].
Specifically, for dynamic partnership networks, the partnerships existing at time t define the momentary network.
In [85,86], the SIS model in continuous time is analysed on dynamic partnership networks that switch from one to another at regular intervals, which we refer to as switching networks.
It seems necessary to agree on the definition of how to construct a partnership edge from a temporal network composed of time-stamped events [41]."
261,"Alternatively, we expect that periods of bilateral sharing may consist of a series of long turns.
The partnerships between 1 and 2 and between 1 and 3 are concurrent in the second scenario (figure 1b) but not in the first scenario (figure 1a).
From a modelling point of view, a partnership is a time window, associated with a pair of individuals, within which a disease can spread between them.
One typically assumes the likelihood of contagion per unit of time to be constant during a partnership and that partnerships do not take a break and start over again.
such that a partnership lasts from the first to the last event between the two individuals.
An increase in τ implies that a partnership lasts longer, which contributes to the increase in the degree of the individual (i.e.
To illustrate this argument, consider the scenario of an individual u having partners v and w in a time period in which v and w have no other partners."
262,"In between FC layers, we included a batch normalization, activation, and dropout layer.
In this study, for activation function, we have preferred Swish (Ramachandran, Zoph & Le, 2017), which is defined as:
We used residual blocks with shortcuts to skip over layers.
Skipping layers helps to reuse the activations of the earlier layers until weight updates in the succeeding layers.
The first dense layer has 512 units and the second layer has five units, corresponding to the five considered gait types, with a softmax activation function to output class probabilities.
The final layer is a two-dimensional softmax, to indicate COVID-19 positive and negative classes respectively."
263,"Fine-tuned hyper-parameters have a great impact on the performance of the model because they directly govern the training of the model.
Within the hyperparameter search space detailed in Supplementary Table 14, 100 random trials were conducted, and the top 5 models were selected.
The selection of hyperparameters has a large impact on model results.
The selection of the hyper-parameters in all the experiments of this paper was also based on the training data.
With the increase of the value of this hyper-parameter, the prediction latency increases but the accuracy also increases as the model is allowed to be more complex.
Experimental results are by nature noisy: results may depend on which specific samples were used to train the models, the random initializations, small differences in hyper-parameters55."
264,"Finally, the class label with the highest probability is used for the prediction.
At each time-step, individuals make transitions between classes according to the corresponding probabilities.
They rather use a softmax function to output a separate value for each class, representing the probability that the input actually belongs to the respective class.
As a result, classes Ci and Cj may be combined into a single class (Cij).
Panel effects are accounted for by assuming that a particular individual is allocated to each class with the same probability for all their choices.
An important aspect of LCCM is the ability to explain behavioural heterogeneity though class membership probabilities using values of individual characteristics, k (zkn) (Equation (5)).
Both are used to adjust the class distribution of a dataset, i.e., the ratio between the different classes in the dataset.
The remaining two classes were chosen randomly from the Wang et al.
Thus, it treats the predicted probabilities of both classes equally."
265,"The outcome of the training model and the cross‐validation are shown in Table 2.
The training parameters and results metrics are shown in Table 1.
They are listed in Table 2and 3 and were optimised by using a leave-p-out cross-validation scheme.
The evaluation results for the best performing classification model, cseBERT, are in Tables 3 and 4.
The overall Alpha scores in Table 3 show a drop in performance estimate between the training and evaluation set, as expected.
The required training and test time using this configuration are summarized in Table 3
."
266,"The learning process stopped when no improvement occurred over 50 consecutive epochs.
The learning rate is reduced whenever the validation loss plateaued.
The learning rate is reduced whenever the validation loss plateaued.
In such a case, fewer training epochs are needed to adjust the model to a particular task.
Often the learning rate is decreased during the training process.
Note that the learning rate is initially selected as 1e-4, then is reduced by a factor of 0.5 when the test loss is not improved within 25 epoch.
Moreover, the training phase can continue as long as the network keeps improving, as measured by continuous performance monitoring."
267,"We use the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to represent the performance of an individual model.
To evaluate the DLS across different operating points, we calculated the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (area under ROC, AUC).
The performance of the prediction models could also be measured by AUC (i.e., Area under the ROC Curve).
From these ROC curves, the decision that achieves an equal error rate (γ
EE) was computed.
The mean ROC curves for the optimised classifier of each architecture are shown in Fig.
Here the ‘curve’ is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) which traces a measure of the classification accuracy of the ADT for each value of a real-valued discrimination threshold.
The general ROC curve and PR curve are presented in Fig.
The inner-loop ROC values were used for the hyperparameter optimisation, while the average of the outer-loop ROC values indicates final classifier performance on the independent held-out test sets."
268,"But instead of using all the predictors, it uses a regularized path to select the most important variables and only use them in the logistic regression.
The models were evaluated as cross-reference benchmarking activities discussed in upcoming results sections.
To this end, we built an independent test dataset to evaluate the generalizability of the models further.
The same behavior presented in Brazilian cases is presented in the American, which the VMD–CUBIST in overall had better average performance compared to the other models.
We evaluated which model generalized best to the dataset available using the MAPE metric.
Therefore, we have utilized it to identify the principal features in model prediction."
269,"Since the data had nine dimensions (from nine relevant AUs) we first reduced the dimension to two.
This is described as high-dimensional data, where the number of features exceeds the number of observations.
The details of the high-level data schema in Dimensions, including information about coverage and the treatment of unique identifiers is described in several recent publications, for example, Hook et al.
The data structures that naturally emerge when taking this approach to creating Dimensions are well suited to the analysis that we will showcase here.
The Dimensions dataset is built on open unique identifiers wherever possible.
The Dimensions data shown here is in the private space of Digital Science (access available via subscription)2.
Full details of the Dimensions data structure and approach can be found in Hook et al.
This totals the number of data sets spanning three input dimensions to 18 scenarios.
In particular, the instantaneous two-dimensional collection “inst1_2d_asm_Nx (M2I1NXASM)” from NASA was used.

First, a small world20,21 network that includes agents of high connectivity while still keeping the simple grid structure.
We chose this graph topology because small world networks exhibit some attributes of real-world social networks (low diameter and triadic closure).
The average path length between firms, or the number of steps between them through supply chains, is 4.8, indicating a small-world network.
Writing dG(u, v) for the number of connections on the shortest path between nodes u and v, (also called: graph distance), the average distance becomes(1)Dist¯(N):=1(N2)∑u,vdG(u,v)=Θ(N).
Mathematically, the small world phenomenon means that the average graph distance Dist¯(N)=∑u,vdG(u,v)/(N2) in the network is small, at most logarithmic in the network size."
271,"For scale-free networks, the selective removal of hubs produced a much greater impact on structural network integrity, as measured through increases in shortest-path lengths, than simply removing randomly selected nodes15.
Measures are taken only once from the intact network and are not recomputed after each removal step.
Finally, highly connected nodes will be detected and the nodes, and therefore all the edges of that node, will be removed from the network.
In preferential attachment, the more connected a node is, the quicker it acquires more new connections.
See [43] and references therein for the role of long-connections.
One way to reduce the number of long-range connection in the network is by increasing the parameter α in GIRG.
Another way to reduce the number of long-range connection in the network is by removing long-edges in the network.
The removal of these connections, in turn, also reduces the number of connections of other vertices.
Thus, the resulting network has maximal node degree at most M. Since we removed connections randomly, some long connections still remain in the network if they were originally present."
272,"Both hard ensemble and soft ensemble use the last m (m ≤ M) model’s softmax outputs since these models have a tendency to have the lowest test error.
We also consider class weights to obtain a softmax score before applying the ensemble.
Let Oi(x) be the softmax score of the test sample x of the i-th snapshot model.
Using hard ensemble, the prediction of the i-th snapshot model is defined as
The final ensemble constrains to aggregate the votes of the classification labels (i.e., COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia) in the other snapshot models and predict the category with the most votes.
On the other hand, the output of the soft ensemble includes averaging the predicted probabilities of class labels in the last m snapshots model defined as
The creation of model snapshots and ensemble predictions are integrated at the end of the proposed architecture, as shown in Fig.
We implement two ensemble strategies: hard ensemble and soft ensemble.
Moreover, in the case of overall accuracy, the hard ensemble shows better detection performance than the soft ensemble."
273,"“Methodology” explains the details of the dataset and presents the ECOVNet architecture.
Table 5 reports the prediction performances of the proposed ECOVNet model without using ensemble.
Without augmentation, under the condition of without ensemble, ECOVNet’s accuracy reaches 96.26%, and its performance is lower for with augmentation, reaching 94.68% accuracy.
4, the proposed ECOVNet (base models B0-B5) is aimed at the precision, recall, and F1-score of the soft ensemble of test data considering the COVID-19 cases.
Also, ensemble predictions improve the performance by exploiting the predictions obtained from the proposed ECOVNet model snapshots.
The results of our empirical evaluations show that the soft ensemble of the proposed ECOVNet model snapshots outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods."
274,"We also analyze 11,122,017 papers published from 2010 onwards to identify the earliest usage of a grant and infer if it was new in 2020.

This dependence relation is nontrivial and determined by the interlayer degree correlation of the network.
In a random regular network with degree k, each node then has kp/2 unidirectional incoming edges, kp/2 unidirectional outgoing edges, and k(1−p) bidirectional edges.
In the simulations, we generate two uncorrelated networks, A and B, of equal size using the Molloy-Reed algorithm [56].
Note that for the empirical network (coauthorship network) (f), the mean degree is smaller than that of (a)-(e).

However, there is still lacking solid rationale to clarify what is the best strategy, why and how it is.
We first consider the strategy, proposed by Jonnerby et al.
However, there are also many situations where the simple strategies we discussed above are useless.
Sometimes the answer can even be conditional: “yes” to a safe haven, “no” to a hedge [53].
However, the practical feasibility of such an arrangement may be questionable.
Then, hedging or safe haven strategies could be implemented, as suggested by previous research (Conlon et al., 2020; Conlon and McGee, 2020).
However, to be comprehensible a strategy also needs consistent concepts that are perceived as both understandable and fair.

294,"In addition to the empirical observation of the widespread appearance of such structures, there are obvious theorems of stability.
A recent thesis [5] exploits this underlying structure for linear stability analysis in which many atoms are perturbed.
Bartlett, in his articles Bartlett, 1956, Bartlett, 1957 considered two differential equations to investigate small oscillations around the equilibrium.
However, since the oscillations occur when the solution approaches the steady state in the asymptotically stable regime, we may overlook the potential misbehavior.
While this behavior is non‐physical, it is not mathematically inconsistent with the model behavior and does not represent instability as such.
Thus, to guarantee physical behavior, stability is necessary but not sufficient.
Consequently, the model is structurally stable with respect to these parameters and the
numerical value is of less importance than the quality of the mechanism they control.
It decreases to zero as the system reaches a steady state in a finite system."
295,"The value of Δ was chosen to be 0.2, which meant that each parameter can take 6 unique standardised values - 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 or 1.0.
Again, δ and δ′ deviate from previously reported for English, δ ≈ 0.5 [5, 6, 8].
δ′ may deviate from the expected value because of the value of α retrieved here for Catalan.
To interpret these values, recall that Δ variables were defined as the difference between a destination value minus an origin value.
The two methods are equivalent, with this extra sum being implicitly included in the definition of R(Δ).
This is why R(Δ) is a piece-wise function when the threshold is not one.
For some models it may be easier to do this other method explicitly rather than try to construct R(Δ)."
296,"In particular, we have used the delayed rejection adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) algorithm [32] implemented in pymcmcstat; see [33] for the details.
The estimation may count on such a numerical method as a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo sampling.
Once the model is specified, the inference methodology is automated.
Hence they can be sampled directly, due to the Markov property.)
Unfortunately, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method can be slow for large samples.
To do so, we will resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling [33], [34].
The basic assumption of modeling the filtered MSA is that it is composed of independent samples that follow the Gibbs–Boltzmann distribution Eq.
A precaution must then be made about the memory parameters of Markov, at least when working with the KSG estimation.

As additional proof of the robustness of the results, we considered perturbations to the model parameters, domain sizes, and testing strategies (see Supplementary Figs.
In a second robustness test, we run the model again (calibrated using all input time series), and set each variable group to zero, respectively.
We explore the robustness of the model results presented in Section 5 to the matrix C by exploring three alternative specifications of this matrix in SC Appendix.
We compare various alternative model specifications to check the robustness of our conclusions.
Under similar adjustment to observations, simpler models are preferred since they are more robust from an information-theoretic point of view (Huyvaert, Burnham, & Anderson, 2011)."
299,"Among the limitations of our work is the identifiability of model parameters as SUITHER requires a relatively large set of such parameters to be calibrated.
Some, albeit indirect, verification of the identifiability properties of the model comes from the very large sets of time series on which calibration has been successfully performed.
This is in part due to the fact that we are mostly seeking discrete parameters and not continuous parameters, which creates a form of robustness.
It could be argued that more realistic models are those with a larger number of states and parameters.
This non-idealization is accepted and addressed in the context of model evaluation (see Sec.
We deliberately chose a parsimonious model with a few parameters to avoid identifiability issues.
However, fitting the models to the available data requires specific techniques because of critical issues like partial observation, non-linearities and non-identifiability."
300,"Similar challenges arise when predictions at multiple horizons are issued at the same time.
For instance, in the FluSight challenges [1], forecasts for the timing and strength of seasonal peaks have been assessed.
The prevalent pattern observed in these figures is that a longer prediction horizon often leads to larger prediction errors.
5 presents the box-plots of test set forecasting errors in the SDA horizon for each model and each state.
Due to the recursive strategy adopted, the SDA horizon was chosen to the analysis, once the errors tend to grow as the forecast horizon increases.
5 shows the box-plots of out-of-sample forecasting errors in the SDA horizon for each model and dataset used.
This horizon is chosen to analysis due to the recursive strategy adopted, once the errors increase according to the growth of the forecasting horizon."
301,"Compared to other state of the art modeling approaches that were not discussed in detail in this manuscript, e.g.
4, we provide a discussion of the main results and additional factors to consider in the modeling process.
In this work, we carry out a systematic analysis of various aspects of proposed models.
Another difference between the work [27] and ours is the modelling approach.
Model 2 was developed by incorporating both static independent and static dependent variables into the modeling process.
The modeling and results reported in this manuscript are more closely related to those used in Rule-Based Models.
both the simple version of the model and the generalized version."
302,"The last three inequalities (55)–(57) are trivially satisfied and (54) results from (53), which proves that (53) implies M=GΠ and thus also M=A=GΠ.
The converse, namely that M=GΠ implies (53), follows from the fact that (54) is valid only if (53) holds.
For Imax = 0.4 we see from Proposition 7.1 that M=A=GΠ.
For Imax = 0.15 we see from Proposition 7.1 that M⊊A=GΠ.
For Imax = 0.02 we see from Proposition 7.1 that M⊊A⊊GΠ.
From Proposition 7.2 we see that M⊊A=GΠ for Imax = 0.4."
303,"We make use of a regression model (SVR) to produce our forecasts for 1 to 4 weeks ahead.
However, this test does not have a widely accepted extension to account for dependencies between multiple forecasts made for different time-series or locations.
To choose a forecasting method, the last week of the data are used as a testing set, whereas the earlier data points are used as the training data set.
In the next section, an approach to forecasting the New Tests time series will be demonstrated.
We train the model over one year of data (2019) and test its performance over one month (January 2020) of a 24-h forecast horizon.
We next performed an out-of-sample forecasting test, this time only using data points from the rising part of the dN/dt curve."
304,"On a positive note, we also discuss on-going efforts to counteract these problems.
Finally we provide recommendations on how to further address these problems in the future.
However, in the following we present other examples that can bring some thoughts into the light of this issue.
We therefore think that our results should be borne in mind for future use, as they are of rather general nature.
Conduct a literature review of related works to prove the potential applicability of the proposed solution.
To investigate further, we followed the approach recommended in Ref."
305,"But, even if data were complete and precise, small variations in the parameters bring about growing uncertainties as time elapses.
Uncertainties in the values of the latter prevent a unique interpretation of the data at the transient.
the uncertainty quantification for our predicted curve in electronic supplementary material, Fig.
Our method works reliably well, providing well calibrated uncertainty bounds for individual parameter estimates even in case of small sample sizes and a limited amount of observations.
(14)

This plug-in method ignores the uncertainty in the variance term.
As for the data, we keep the same deviations as in Section “Uncertainty in the initial stage” in all the periods, in the absence of better information.
An additional difficulty when applying this inference framework for large periods of time (months) is the fact that uncertainty in the observed data accumulates over time when using cumulative data.
Comparison of these old projections with observations highlights the fact that the uncertainty must be taken into consideration.
We estimated the statistical uncertainties in the data and propagated these to the uncertainties on R0."
306,"All in all, we showed that our approach is very promising and shows great potential for being applied in similar domains.
We briefly touch on some of the existing concepts here.
We also hope that this work fosters further investigations along these lines as well as novel developments in other directions taking advantage of the techniques we have set up.
We anticipate that future research will benefit from exploring these questions.
Within few months, we saw incredible progresses on this front.
We have made substantial progress in this regard in the past few months as described in the following sections.
Since this work focuses on the sagittal view, future work can consider the integration of frontal view analysis.
By the end of the last century, significant progress in the field was made (a systematic literature review for this period is presented in Anderson and May’s book [3])."
307,"The methods and systems we put forward here could significantly improve the achievement of these goals.
This raises the need to develop new and more general approaches.
However, there are a number of limitations to our present approach that provide opportunities for substantial further refinements.
Exploring the expandability of our approach is an important future task.
We want to point out some of the limitations that the proposed approach can be further improved upon.
Point out the limitations of related works and how the proposed solution may overcome those problems."
308,"However, we noticed that it depends on the value of parameter σα.
To perform this calculation, we use σα=1.69×10−2 (see Table 3) and we obtained the results given in Table 2
.
Because this equation is so general, there is a need to motivate a meaningful choice of β function, and analyze how its effects differ from simple and proportional threshold contagion.
if σ2 is much larger than σ1 (in many cases approximately by a factor of 2).
Before moving on to the cases σ1,2>1, in passing we make three more remarks:
We now move to analysing the case where both σ1,2>1.
We remark that, as before, the approximations are less satisfactory the larger is the difference between σ1 and σ2."
309,"The network from which SVA metrics are calculated must be configured in ways that could amplify SVA signals.
This atypical characteristic poses a unique challenge for SVA that we will attempt to solve presently.
Altogether, this demonstrates the non-trivial challenge in extrapolating a uniform SVA configuration across different scenarios.
Still from Table 8 we can observe that consolidating the underperfoming seed papers into a pseudopaper dramatically improved many key SVA signals.
We intentionally excluded O’Keefe;s paper (S2,1) from the current pseudopaper analysis due to its previous good SVA performance.
We also show that our artificial pseudopaper approach allows the potential structural variations made by a Nobel Prize discovery to be more amenable to detection by SVA metrics.
This technique will be useful in scenarios where the original winning papers tend to emit weak SVA signals.
Through this work, we not only isolated key SVA leading indicators that are representative of the Nobel Prize papers’s qualities but also proposed new techniques for improving SVA signal detection."
310,"In Section Conclusions and future work, we make some remarks about the many ways in which the work in this paper could be extended and generalized.
This is followed by the results and discussions in section 3.
We corrected those errors as explained in Supplementary Section 3.
Later, Section 7 presents a discussion on the obtained results.
In §4, we present a case study and discuss the results.
We addressed those in a separate work, building on the results presented herein (13)."
311,"In Section 4 we comment the results and draw our conclusions.
Section 4 displays the results of our investigation, while Section 5 is dedicated to the discussion of the main results.
We describe our user study in Section 5, before we reveal our results in Section 6.
In Section 4, we provide a few thoughts on both the nature of the results and the ease of their production.
After that, Section 3 discuss some related works and how they were used in our problem, when it is the case.
In Section 6, we discuss our results and their limitations."
